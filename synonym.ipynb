      "Input text: A water company has blamed more people working from home post-pandemic for a new hosepipe ban.South East Water, which supplies more than 2m homes and businesses, will impose the first hosepipe ban of the summer on Monday, affecting households across Kent and Sussex.The company’s chief executive, David Hinton, said that people working from home was a “key factor” behind the ban, as it has “increased drinking water demand”.In a letter to customers, he wrote: “Over the past three years the way in which drinking water is being used across the south-east has changed considerably.“The rise of working from home has increased drinking water demand in commuter towns by around 20% over a very short period, testing our existing infrastructure.”Hinton also blamed low rainfall since April as well as a recent spell of hot weather which he said led to a spike in demand for drinking water.“Our reservoir and aquifer stocks of raw water, essential to our water supply but not ready to be used, are in a good position. However, demand for treated mains water, which takes time to process and deliver, was greater than we could meet,” he said.One South East Water customer accused Mr Hinton of “victim-blaming” and described his letter as “a deflection from the real issue”.Jutta Wrobel, 61, an artist in the village of Wadhurst, East Sussex, said: “It’s not a suitable response … This is a deflection from the real issue which is how to stop South East Water paying away all our money in dividends rather than reinvesting in our water infrastructure, which is a public utility and a human right.”Wrobel started an online petition demanding a change of ownership of South East Water after she was left without mains water for five days earlier this month.She added: “The barrage of victim-blaming by South East Water is what I think has riled people up.“I’m interested in what the regulator is doing about it and whether there will be meaningful sanctions imposed on South East Water.”Greg Clark, the Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells, told the Times: “Their only job is to deliver drinking water. But in my constituency, they have run out of water twice in six months – once just before Christmas when we had a cold snap, and now after a small and unexceptional heatwave.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Following a period of consultation, we will be able to take action against customers who contravene the hosepipe restrictions from Monday 26 June.“The restrictions have been introduced to ensure that we can deliver drinking water to all our customers consistently.“Since the TUB was introduced, we have seen customer demand reduce, bringing down the high demand for tap water. We want to thank our customers for being mindful of their water use and remind them to continue to use water wisely over the coming weekend.”\n",

      "Input text: The mighty aurochs have gone, as have the tarpan horses and the wild boars, but modern-day substitutes have been drafted in to recreate a large open “savannah” on heathland in Dorset.Instead of aurochs, considered the wild ancestor of domestic cattle, 200 red Devon cattle are to be found roaming the Purbeck Heaths, while Exmoor ponies are stand-ins for the tarpan horses and curly coated Mangalitsa pigs are doing the sort of rooting around that boars used to excel at here.The idea of the project is to create more of the sort of habitat where precious species such as the sand lizard, southern damselfly and heath tiger beetle can thrive.Two Exmoor ponies at Purbeck Heaths. Photograph: National Trust ImagesIt comes three years after the UK’s first “super national nature reserve” was created in Dorset, knitting together 3,400 hectares (8,400 acres) of priority habitat. Within the super reserve, 1,370 hectares of open “savannah” for free-ranging, grazing animals as it would have been thousands of years ago is being developed with the cattle, ponies and pigs roaming freely to graze alongside deer to help shape a more diverse landscape with richer habitats.David Brown, the National Trust’s lead ecologist for Purbeck, said: “Over large swathes of open grassland and heath, these domestic grazers are now mimicking their wild ancestors, who would have shaped habitats in the past.“We can’t bring back aurochs but we can use our 200 red Devon cattle to graze and behave in equivalent ways. Similarly, Exmoor ponies mimic the actions of extinct tarpan horses, and the quirky, curly coated Mangalitsa pigs are rooting around like wild boars.Mangalitsa pig. Photograph: Terry Bagley/National Trust Images“We’re also discovering that by letting them get on with their own thing as much as possible, our grazing animals explore new habitats and discover different types of vegetation to eat – all of which help create a more dynamic and complex ecosystem.”Large herbivores can play a crucial role in helping plants and less mobile insect species move around the landscape, carrying seeds and larvae on their fur and hooves, or in their dung.By giving cattle, ponies and pigs this landscape to wander around, they are helping rare and threatened species such as Purbeck mason wasps, and heath bee-flies disperse and build stronger populations.Red Devon cattle. Photograph: National Trust ImagesBrown said: “Grazing in their own individual ways, these animals are slowly forming diverse, wildlife friendly habitats. Cattle are untidy eaters, leaving messy tussocks perfect for insects; pigs turn over the soil and help sand lizards burrow; and ponies nibble tightly down to the ground creating grassland lawns full of specialist flowers such as stork’s-bill and waxcap fungi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It’s the perfect mix of habitats in which biodiversity can thrive, and a great landscape for people to also roam freely.”Heath tiger beetle at the super reserve. Photograph: Terry Bagley/National Trust ImagesThere have been some unexpected consequences. Peter Robertson, the RSPB senior site manager, said: “What has come as a surprise is how they have created new ponds by wallowing in water-logged areas and have opened up areas of salt marsh by foraging for shellfish.”The Purbeck Heaths super reserve, which is to be the base for BBC Two’s Springwatch from Monday, is a mosaic of lowland wet and dry heath, valley mires, acid grassland and woodland, along with coastal sand dunes, lakes and salt marsh.Already one of the most biodiverse places in the UK, it is home to thousands of species of wildlife, including all six native reptiles – the adder, grass snake, slow worm, sand lizard, smooth snake and viviparous lizard.\n",

      "Input text: Large numbers of fungi have been found living in the twilight zone of the ocean, and could unlock the door to new drugs that may match the power of penicillin.The largest ever study of ocean DNA, published by the journal Frontiers in Science, has revealed intriguing secrets about the abundance of fungi in the part of the ocean that is just beyond the reach of sunlight. At between 200 metres and 1,000 metres below the surface, the twilight zone is home to a variety of organisms and animals, including specially adapted fish such as lantern sharks and kitefin sharks, which have huge eyes and glowing, bioluminescent skin.“Penicillin is an antibiotic that originally came from a fungus called Penicillium so we might find something like that from these ocean fungi,” said Fabio Favoretto, a postdoctoral scholar at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. The twilight zone is characterised by high pressure, a lack of light and cold temperatures, which presents an extreme environment “where fungi might exhibit unique adaptations”, he added. “That could potentially lead to the discovery of new species with unique biochemical properties.”Deep-sea mining: why is interest growing and what are the risks?Read moreThe new ocean DNA catalogue, launched on Tuesday, contains more than 317m marine organism gene groups compiled from samples collected on voyages including the four-year Tara Oceans expedition which started in 2009, and the 2010 Malaspina Circumnavigation expedition.Advances in technology meant existing samples could provide much more data than before, while the process of cataloguing helped open new doors into the understudied ocean, said the marine biologist and the paper’s lead author, Elisa Laiolo.The marine biotechnology sector, which relies on ocean organisms and their genes, is worth an estimated $6bn, a figure expected to almost double by 2032.Laiolo was surprised to see so many fungi living in the ocean’s twilight zone. “There have been some indications of it [fungi abundance at this level] before, so this is another piece of the puzzle.”Another critical discovery made during the cataloguing process, said Carlos Duarte, a marine science professor and senior author of the study, was the role viruses played in boosting gene diversity. “The viruses insert themselves and move genes from one organism to another. That means viruses create genomic biodiversity and that accelerates their evolution.”One result of that acceleration, he said, were genes that had evolved to enable organisms to chew through plastic. “They can degrade synthetic polymers, derived from hydrocarbons, which are very recent as a pollutant in the ocean, showing that evolution happened in a few decades.”The catalogue also highlighted gaps in our understanding of the ocean floor, said Laiolo. “It is easier to sample the water than the ocean floor and what we underline in the paper is the need to increase studies targeting the seabed in the future.”A Rosette sampler aboard the Hespérides, one of the two ships used for the Malaspina expedition in 2010. Data collected then has been included in the new catalogue. Photograph: Joan Costa/CSICDevelopments in supercomputing and sequencing technologies, she said, means more information can be gleaned from existing samples, at much lower costs.Despite the catalogue’s benefits, Duarte said there were problems with marine gene ownership and sharing of the benefits, particularly with countries in the global south that lacked the same access to gene-sequencing and analytical supercomputing. “Currently, 10 nations own 90% of marine gene patents, the benefits are not being shared,” he said.Changes to ownership rules are being made, however. “Since October last year a new treaty came into force that says those that discover a marine gene, own it.” said Duarte. “But they have to share the benefits. The problem is, it’s not clear how that benefit sharing is going to work.”The catalogue’s release was welcomed by marine scientists. Favoretto described it as a “remarkable resource for biodiversity assessment and conservation efforts” that would enable researchers to monitor changes in species distribution, particularly in relation to the impact of the climate crisis and human activities.\n",

      "Input text: Crisis talks are continuing about the future of Thames Water. But what are the options for the country’s largest water and sewerage company?Special administrationThis is a power within the Water Industry Act 1991 to protect essential services for the public if a private company is either on the brink of collapse, or not fulfilling its legal obligations.It arranges to transfer the business as a going concern and, just as administrators do in other financial collapses, it enables them to carry out the functions of the company until that transfer. Crucially it is designed to protect an essential public service first and creditors do not have priority in getting their loans paid off.The company can be eventually transferred to another private company, as in the case of the electricity company Bulb in 2022, when the government subsidised the continued existence of Bulb as a private company and then transferred it to another private company. But it can also be used to transfer a company into public ownership, as in the case of Railtrack. When the privatised company owning the railway network collapsed in 2002 the special administration process resulted in a transfer to public ownership under Network Rail.Public English regional water companyDavid Hall, an expert in public utilities after privatisation, suggests special administration could be used for all three of the failing water companies serving the south-east of England. Southern Water, South East Water and Thames Water could be taken into special administration and transferred into public ownership under the councils in the region as the first regional publicly owned water company.Enforcement under section 18 of the Water Industry ActUnder the Water Industry Act 1991, ministers and the regulator can issue enforcement orders for a company to do their bidding – whether it is paying down debts, restructuring, reducing payouts to shareholders or keeping water bills down. Nevertheless, this could result in ministers being involved in the running of the company for many years – effectively a nationalisation under the definition of the National Statistics Office, but without any local accountability and participation. It could be strongly resisted by the private owners.Let Thames Water go bustThis endgame of a solution has been suggested as a way to take the company back into public ownership, by paying a penny for a collapsed company. But when water was privatised, there were safeguards to protect what is an essential public utility. Put simply, ministers and the regulator are not allowed to let this happen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This has been driven by public outrage and political takeup as a mainstream issue of the most visible symptoms of decades of underinvestment: raw sewage discharges.Ofwat told companies this year they could not pay out dividends if it meant their financial stability suffered. It is scrutinising more closely the financial viability of water companies, in particular the level of debt they hold compared with the company’s value, which in the case of Thames Water is an industry high at 80%.As a result of Ofwat pressure, the scandal of sewage discharges and the need to invest in infrastructure, shareholders are being asked to stump up more money to support Thames Water and plug – according to some insiders – a £10bn funding gap. So far they have provided £500m and promised a further £1bn.\n",

      "Input text: Authorities in eastern Switzerland have ordered residents of the village of Brienz to evacuate by Friday evening because geologists say a mass of 2m cubic metres of Alpine rock looming overhead could break loose and spill down in coming weeks.Local leaders told a town hall and press event on Tuesday that residents would have to leave by 6pm on Friday but could return to the village from time to time starting on Saturday, depending on the risk level, but not stay overnight.Officials said measurements indicated a “strong acceleration over a large area” in recent days, and “up to 2m cubic metres of rock material will collapse or slide in the coming seven to 24 days”.The centuries-old village straddles German- and Romansch-speaking parts of the eastern Graubünden region, sitting south-west of Davos at an altitude of about 1,150 metres (3,800ft). Today it has fewer than 100 residents. Locals said the mountain and the rocks on it had been moving since the last ice age, according to officials.Over the last century, the village itself has moved a few centimetres each year – but the movement has accelerated over the last 20 years, and the landslide has now been moving about one metre a year. Geological surveys suggest the situation has become even more precarious.Melting glaciers in Alps threaten biodiversity of invertebrates, says studyRead moreChristian Gartmann, a member of the crisis management board in the town of Albula, which counts Brienz in its municipality, said experts estimated there was a 60% chance that the rock would fall in smaller chunks, which may not even reach the village or the valley. It could also move slowly. But there was also a 10% chance the whole 2m cubic metres mass may tumble down – threatening lives, property and the village itself, he said.“We hope that the village stays intact,” he said by phone. “We can’t eliminate the possibility that it [the rock] will come down … It could damage the village or destroy it.”Gartmann said that glacier melt had affected the precariousness of the rocks over millennia but that glacier melt due to human-made climate change in recent decades was not a factor.Experts deemed that a controlled explosion to set off a rockslide was too dangerous because it would require drilling underneath the rock – itself a hazardous operation, Gartmann said. Erecting a giant pile of sand or a wall to try to block any spillage was not considered feasible, he said, adding that the wall would have to be at least 70 metres high to protect the village.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s just one of those things that shows what you take for granted, all the invisible services we rely on.”\n",

      "The Transport Workers’ Union filed a lawsuit in the federal court this week, seeking maximum penalties of up to $125,000 against the waste management firm Cleanaway.Cleanaway is contracted by the City of Sydney council, which is expecting more than 78,000 people to descend on to its streets in the coming days as part of WorldPride, the world’s largest LGBTQ+ event.The union alleges that the company, which is the target of the strikes, stalled proposed industrial action last year by failing to comply with the terms of orders issued by the Fair Work Commission that would have allowed members at its Erskine Park and Hillsdale sites to vote on which protests they wanted to take part in.The commission has accepted a proposal to hold a hearing next Wednesday in an attempt to find a solution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are Australia’s global city, with the highest density population, and our waste collection is paramount – especially in the lead-up to WorldPride where we will once again be on the global stage.”Moore said the cleaning teams that maintain public spaces are internal and their operations won’t be affected by the strike.“We will also have additional teams working hard during Sydney WorldPride to keep the city clean, particularly before and after major events,” she said.\n",

      "Input text: The Middle Eastern herb za’atar, which is also known as Syrian oregano, or Origanum syriacum, grows across the Levant and has a unique and intoxicating flavour similar to thyme and marjoram, but with a broader, longer leaf. Za’atar is most commonly known, however, as a spice mix that contains the herb, usually combined with sesame seeds, cumin, coriander and sumac, and that has a sour, citrus twang.Like many others, Acme Fire Cult, a barbecue restaurant in east London founded by chefs Daniel Watkins and Andrew Clarke, makes its own za’atar-style spice mix, which is a brilliant way to use up surplus herbs and herb stalks.Za’atar-style spice mixI have never seen the fresh herb za’atar in the UK, but the spice mix of the same name is a super-versatile condiment, seasoning and marinade that can elevate all kinds of dishes. It’s often used to flavour flatbreads or to marinate meat and vegetables – I love it sprinkled over almost any simple meal, from a salad to a roast dinner or stew. This recipe, based on one from Daniel Watkins, is remarkably similar to the classic herb-and-spice mixture and very satisfying to make – just a small bunch of rescued herb stalks and/or surplus soft herbs will yield a decent little jar of this magical Levantine seasoning. It will keep for up to a year, too.Makes About 15 tbsp100g surplus herbs and/or herb stalks25g sesame seeds2½ tsp cumin seeds2½ tsp coriander seeds3 tsp dried thyme, marjoram or oregano, or a combination of all three5 tsp sumac3 tsp flaky sea saltBlanch the herbs in boiling water for 15 seconds, then drain and transfer to a bowl of iced water. Drain again, then put in a clean tea towel and squeeze dry. Roughly chop the herbs then spread them out on a baking tray and leave in a warm spot to dry for a few days (or dry them in the residual heat of the oven after using it for another purpose). Once dry, grind to a coarse powder in a mortar, spice grinder or blender, then tip into a small bowl.Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan until they start to brown, then add to the herb bowl. In the same pan, toast the cumin and coriander seeds until they begin to pop and smell aromatic, then grind to a medium-fine powder and add to the herb bowl. Stir in the dried thyme, marjoram or oregano (or combination of all three), the sumac and the salt, then decant into a clean jar and seal. The mix will keep for up to a year.\n",

      "Input text: Victorians face a more than doubling of transmission charges on electricity bills if the state government proceeds with plans for what is likely to be the most costly and longest single power line in Australia’s history, a thinktank says in a new report.The report by the Victoria Energy Policy Centre (VEPC) argues the proposed 500 kilovolt VNI West transmission line linking Melbourne’s outskirts with Wagga Wagga on an 800km path will be far costlier than alternatives and faces extensive landholder opposition. It also will not solve grid bottlenecks holding back new solar and windfarms in the state.The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), which first proposed VNI West as a $2.7bn project in 2018 and is Victoria’s main planner for transmission, estimated users’ transmission charges would need to rise by a quarter. That assessment, though, was based on 2021 prices and ignored interest costs that have since soared.Victoria announces ban on gas connections to new homes from January 2024Read moreThe report estimates the Victorian portion of the line alone will cost $4.9bn in current dollars. Add in a further $3bn needed for upgrades to the existing 220kV networks to integrate VNI West, and the full cost could swell to $11bn and lift Victorians’ transmission charges by at least 124%.“The cost has blown out again and again and again,” said Bruce Mountain, the VEPC’s director and one of the report’s authors. “Aemo rightfully should long since have said, ‘We need to think again, this is not getting anywhere.’”\n",

      "The falling price of renewables has offered nations endowed with lots of wind and sunshine potentially low-cost ways to decarbonise their economies. However, planning the transition is proving to be challenging, while the global rush to introduce new technologies to head off global heating means equipment prices are rocketing.Victoria’s energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the government would consider the report “but rigorous analysis by Aemo shows that VNI-West provides value to Victorian energy consumers, helping to keep the lights on across the state as our ageing coal-fired generators close”.“New transmission is vital for securing affordable and reliable renewable energy for Victorians – these projects will form part of the national electricity grid, allowing 3.4GW of new renewable generation to be built in Victoria,” D’Ambrosio said, adding that state agency Vicgrid was “already providing greater oversight of the [Western Renewables Link] and VNI West projects”.Merryn York, an Aemo executive general manager, said the agency had addressed the centre’s claims previously. Such reports created “on-going confusion and concern for landholders and communities”.“Our consultation process for VNI West involved hundreds of stakeholders to identify a preferred option that is forecast to deliver $1.4bn in net market benefits, and harness 3,400 megawatts of renewable generation in Victoria – enough to meet the annual electricity needs for approximately 2.3m homes,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The onus was also on the agency to demonstrate how the VNI West plan squared with Victoria’s target of sourcing 95% of its electricity from renewables by 2035.VNI West, too, implied Victoria would need to rely on New South Wales for much of its electricity even though its northern neighbour was potentially in an even more precarious power position as ageing coal plants exit the grid, Mountain said.\n",

      "Input text: Putting more electric trucks on Australian roads would cut transport pollution faster than electric cars could and governments should introduce grants and zero-emission zones to accelerate their adoption, a new report recommends.The study, from the logistics firm Adiona Tech, also found that replacing 10 delivery trucks with electric models would have the same impact as putting 56 electric cars on the road.Labor’s electric vehicle policy drives Australia forward – but not far | Adam MortonRead moreThe findings come as freight and industry transport bodies called on the federal government to develop a dedicated policy to support electric trucks after its national electric vehicle strategy failed to address larger modes of transport.Adiona Tech’s chief executive, Richard Savoie, said electrifying the largest vehicles on Australian roads should be considered “low-hanging fruit” by the government as swapping diesel trucks with electric models would significantly cut pollution.\n",

      "“Australia is already behind every other developed nation on electric vehicles and while we’re playing catch-up we can’t forget the biggest emitters on the road: freight and transport vehicles,” he said.“Australia must prioritise the electrification of these vehicles that are on the road most, travel the longest distances and are the least fuel-efficient.”The Connected Thinking report found 200 lithium batteries could cut more emissions when used to power light commercial vehicles, such as vans, than passenger cars, and just 10 electric delivery trucks would have the impact of 56 electric cars based on distance travelled, fuel efficiency and emissions.Large, articulated trucks also created 15% of transport emissions even though they made up 1% of the vehicle fleet, it found, as they travelled six times as far as passenger cars, used 40 times more fuel, and produced 50 times more pollution.The report called for grants to help businesses electrify truck fleets and for the introduction of “low or zero-emissions zones” where petrol and diesel vehicles would face restrictions or charges.“The national EV strategy is a start but we need low-emissions zones yesterday,” Savoie said.The report was released on the same day the Electric Vehicle Council, the Australian Trucking Association, the Heavy Vehicle Industry Association and the Australian Hydrogen Council joined a call for the development of a “national zero-emission truck strategy”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "Input text: Mammals that live in groups generally have longer lifespans than solitary species, new research into nearly 1,000 different animals suggests.Scientists from China and Australia compared 974 mammal species, analysing longevity and how they tended to be socially organised.Classifying mammals into three categories – solitary, pair-living and group-living – the researchers found that animals who lived in groups, such as elephants and zebras, tended to live longer on average than solitary species such as the aardvark and eastern chipmunk.How rehoming wildlife from rhinos to bison can revive threatened speciesRead moreThe correlation held even when the researchers took into account a link between larger species size and longer lifespan.The maximum lifespan of mammals varies from about two years in shrews to more than 200 years in bowhead whales.Northern short-tailed shrews – which are solitary animals – and group-living greater horseshoe bats are similar in weight, for example, but live to a maximum of around two and 30 years respectively.The researchers also conducted genetic analysis for 94 species, and identified 31 genes that were associated with both social organisation and longevity.The genes were primarily immunity- and hormone-related, the latter of which the study’s authors say could play a role in social behaviour.The study’s authors hypothesise that “group living reduces extrinsic mortality by limiting the risks of predation and starvation, and the strong and stable social bonds formed among group members have the power to enhance longevity”.“These benefits are expected to override the costs inherent in group living, such as competition for mating partners and food, stress from higher ranking individuals, and the spread of infectious diseases via social contacts,” they wrote.Previous research into specific group-living species, such as chacma baboons, has found that individuals with strong social bonds lived longer than those with weaker and less stable relationships. Scientists have documented similar findings in rhesus macaques.But sociality seems to play a different role in animals that don’t necessarily live in groups. A 2018 paper in yellow-bellied marmots – a “socially flexible” species – linked strong social relationships to decreased longevity.Whether longevity confers any evolutionary advantage is contentious. Assoc Prof Celine Frere, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Queensland who was not involved in the research, said some short-lived animals reproduced much faster than longer-living species.‘Group living reduces extrinsic mortality by limiting the risks of predation and starvation,’ the study’s authors wrote. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images“From an evolutionary context, what an individual seeks to do is to pass on its genes to future generations,” she said. “An animal that lives two years versus a whale that lives 200 years most likely have produced the same amount of offspring across their lifetimes.”Frere said the study’s findings were interesting but that its categorisation of species as being solitary, pair-living or group-living was a “simplistic approach to look at social organisation”. Animals bred in captivity develop physical changes that may hinder survival in the wild, research findsRead more“They want to imply that group-living species live longer. But it’s much more complicated than that. [Lifespan] is tied to their ecology. It’s tied to their reproductive biology, it’s tied to their mating system.“Whether you’re a solitary animal or a group-living animal, you have to learn to live with others … and you will compete with others for access to resources.”Frere added that social organisation varied significantly among group-living mammals, ranging from highly structured dominance hierarchies to fission-fusion societies, in which the size and makeup of social groups change over time.The research was published in the journal Nature Communications.\n",

      "Input text: Ministers have been told they will be “punished” by voters after analysis revealed the decline of vital flood defences across England.The proportion of critical assets in disrepair has almost trebled in the West Midlands and the east of England since 2018, leaving thousands of homes and businesses more vulnerable to storms.Critical assets are defined as those where there is a high risk to life and property if they fail.The east of England, which spans the Conservative heartlands from Suffolk to Bedfordshire and Essex, has one of the highest proportion of rundown flood defences in England, with nearly one in 11 – more than 850 assets – considered “poor” or “very poor” by Environment Agency inspectors.Chart showing percentage decline in condition of flood defences classed as poor or very poor in English regionsSteve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, said: “The Conservatives’ sticking-plaster approach to flooding has left communities devastated and cost the economy billions of pounds.”Using Environment Agency data obtained by Greenpeace’s investigative arm, Unearthed, the Guardian tracked the state of England’s vital flood defences from 2018 to 2022.The analysis revealed a sharp rise in the proportion of critical assets in disrepair across many parts of the country.In the east Midlands, which was deluged by Storm Babet in October, the proportion of flood defences in the worst conditions has almost doubled in the last five years.Together with the east of England, the north-west has the highest rate of flood defences so damaged they are almost useless, with one in 11 defences considered in disrepair in 2022 – more than 815 – up from one in 16 in 2018.In the West Midlands, the rate of ruined assets has risen from one in 44 in 2018 to one in 14 last year.The number of damaged flood defences has increased across all regions in the last five years. However, the analysis examined the proportion of flood defences in disrepair rather than the number because thousands more assets have been built since 2018.Experts said the picture of disrepair was likely to worsen after higher costs and budget shortfalls forced the Environment Agency to axe a quarter of its new flood defence projects.Georgia Whitaker, Greenpeace UK’s climate campaigner, said the analysis painted a “grim and desperate picture”.Graph plotting state of district flood defences v level of flood riskShe said there was “absolutely no excuse for this lack of preparation” from the government, and added: “If politicians fail to commit to crucial climate action, they risk being punished at the ballot box.”In total, 4,204 of England’s most important flood defences were in a poor or very poor condition in 2022. This accounts for about one in 15 of the total, up from the one in 25 registered four years ago.Of these, 856 were judged very poor, meaning they had “severe defects resulting in complete performance failure”, essentially rendering them useless.The remaining 3,348 were in poor condition, meaning they have defects that would “significantly reduce” their performance.The government’s environment department (Defra) claimed that more than 61,500 flood defences met the required condition and that 2,400 did not, but the Guardian has not been able to verify this data.A spokesperson said mitigation measures, such as increased inspections, would be put in place when assets were not found to be in the right standard.Defra said: “Flooding can be devastating to communities – which is why we are investing a record £5.2bn between 2021 and 2027 to better protect hundreds of thousands of properties, including over £200m a year for maintaining of flood defences.”The Environment Agency has slashed the number of homes it expects to protect from flooding over the next five years as higher costs have forced it to scale back projects.A National Audit Office report last month said the agency had pledged to protect 336,000 properties from the risk of flooding by 2027 – but that this had been cut to 200,000 – a reduction of 40%.The Environment Agency also removed 500 of the 2,000 new flood defence projects originally included in its six-year flood and coastal erosion programme.\n",

      "Input text: David Attenborough has claimed that humanity needs to learn to show more restraint for the good of the natural world. Speaking ahead of the broadcast of Planet Earth III, a new instalment of his landmark natural history series, he talked about how one episode focuses on chimpanzees whose forest homes have been encircled by human settlements.“The huge problem is the way we have gobbled up space as though it belongs to us and nobody else,” said Attenborough. “And the notion that you should actually have to restrain yourself in order to accommodate the natural world is not one which everybody feels. We need to persuade people that it’s quite a selfish thing to do.”“Apart from anything else, we depend upon the natural world … and we had assumed that we could do what we like, because the natural world was always there. It is not always there. Simply because we have now become such a dominant species in terms of numbers, we have come to realise that we have to live together, and not just entirely on the terms that we choose.”The broadcaster claimed that the BBC played a significant part in the general public’s awareness of the climate crisis, having allowed him to reference rising planetary temperatures and the disappearance of wilderness since the 1950s – which was initially seen as “an oddball thing to say”.“It is the one organisation that has recognised that it’s an important issue, but also, it’s an issue which people are interested in, and … full of drama and excitement and worth watching,” claimed Attenborough in conversation with Planet Earth executive producer Mike Gunton. “The BBC has been faithful to that tradition … no other broadcasting organisation that I know of has.”The upcoming series of Planet Earth is set to feature underwater scenes shot with a bespoke “whalecam”, a “drone ballet”, and footage of researchers teaching bald ibis chicks how to fly via a microlight. It will also include scenes of mating rituals between tragopan pheasants – a continuation of the broadcaster’s enthusiasm for turning the love lives of birds into attention-grabbing television.“Bird courtship is just one of the most dramatic sequences you can get, because it’s designed to impress a female, and it impresses you!” said Attenborough. “It’s not only feathers, but they also have these extendable sacks on the throats, which they can inflate into the most wonderful patterns. It’s nature showing off, and by golly, you have to be without soul if you aren’t impressed by that sort of stuff.”\n",

      "Input text: A new study of New Zealand’s freshwater quality has painted a sobering picture, showing that E coli is seeping through three-quarters of the land and into waterways at higher levels than national regulations allow.The report, funded by the government-backed organisation Our Land and Water, looked at how rivers, lakes, and estuaries are polluted by four major contaminants, including E coli, a bacteria found in the intestines of many animals and humans that can cause serious illness.Only 2% of New Zealand’s large lakes are in good health, bleak report findsRead moreIt highlights the challenge New Zealand faces in bringing contaminant levels down in line with the guidelines outlined in the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management.“The big picture that we see in terms of water quality is the impact of agriculture, which is quite ubiquitous because agriculture occupies about 35% of our total land use,” said Ton Snelder, director of LWP, a company involved in creating the report.“There are other land uses in particular, urban land use that can also have quite a significant impact on water quality,” he said.Along with E. coli, the report looked at levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment at 850 water monitoring sites across the country and modelled how those contaminates might affect New Zealand’s 650,000 river segments, 961 lakes and 419 estuaries. Nitrogen and phosphorus naturally occur in soil, but dangerous levels are often attributed to farming byproducts, such as cattle urine. Sediment is another naturally occurring pollutant that can reach unhealthy levels due to human-caused erosion as well as urban and agricultural land use.The report found that substantial reductions of at least one of the four contaminants were required in almost all regions of the country to meet national regulations. Maps generated by the report’s data demonstrate the human impact on waterways – the sparsely populated west coast of New Zealand’s South Island shows low levels of the contaminants. However, areas such as Canterbury, which has intensive dairy farming, and Auckland, the country’s largest city, show high levels of either nitrogen or E. coli.Reducing contaminants falls to local councils, which are required to regulate farms and urban areas to improve freshwater. Richard McDowell, a chief scientist at Our Land and Water and professor at Lincoln University, said nitrogen and phosphorus in waterways can decrease when farmers use less fertiliser and ensure cattle effluent from dairy sheds does not run into waterways.Land use change, such as switching from dairy to forestry or crops where suitable, can improve water quality, McDowell said, acknowledging the balance between environmental and social challenges. In recent years, farmers have blamed rural unemployment on high numbers of cattle farms converting to forestry.Unrelated to the study, New Zealand has seen a handful of swimming areas off-limits due to water pollution. Traces of human faeces were recently found in the waters of Corsair Bay, a popular Christchurch swimming spot. In Auckland, a burst sewage pipe near the Hauraki Gulf spewed raw sewage into the harbour for weeks until the issue was temporarily fixed. In parts of the upmarket mountain town of Queenstown, a “boil water notice has been in place since mid-September due to an outbreak of cryptosporidium, which can cause diarrhoea and stomach cramps. The likely cause is human or animal faeces.\n",

      "Input text: A new website that says it represents Northern Territorians who support fracking in the Beetaloo Basin appears shrouded in mystery with no details about who is behind it.Environmentalists have concerns that the site, which calls itself the Beetaloo Economic Alliance, could be an example of astroturfing, a term that describes where a fake grassroots campaign is used to obscure marketing or PR.Hannah Ekin, a spokesperson for the Central Australian Frack Free Alliance (Caffa), said it had “all the markers” of an astroturfing campaign.Northern Territory faces legal challenge over approval of Tamboran drilling and fracking in Beetaloo basinRead moreThe site was discovered as Caffa announced it was taking the NT government to the supreme court over an alleged failure to consider the environmental impacts of the fracking project by resources company Tamboran in the Beetaloo Basin.The website presents pictures of men in hard hats with the claim: “Your opportunity is under attack! The only question is, are you going to allow it?” and has a “take action” button that links to a template to send MPs an email in support of the Tamboran project.There is no contact information and only two working links. One to a piece by the Australian endorsing the project and another to a clip from the ABC titled: “Industry says gas from the Beetaloo Basin could solve Australia’s energy crisis.”There is a Facebook page with no followers and a Twitter account with three followers and 54 following. It has been posted to 10 times since its inception in early December 2022. The message function is barred.\n",

      "Mudburra elder Ray Dimakarri Dixon, an anti-fracking campaigner in the region, is furious at the unauthorised use of his image to promote the purported “grassroots” campaign.Near the bottom of the webpage is a picture of Dixon with the slogan: “No impact on air quality. A three year study by the CSIRO published earlier this year found fracking had no impact on air quality.”Dixon said he was stunned by seeing his image used to promote fracking.“They didn’t contact me,” Dixon said. “I am shocked about it.“It’s me on my country. I’m standing up on my own for my country, for my water. I’m not saying yes to fracking or for any mining company. No. It’s just destroying our identity and it’s destroying who we are.”Ekin described the images of Dixon as offensive and clumsy.“Ray has been in the press many, many times saying that he is against fracking,” Ekin said. “Whoever’s making this website clearly doesn’t understand anything about the territory.

The fact that pro-fracking sites like this, and Back Beetaloo, seem to be able to operate with no consequences is deeply problematic.”Jack Fuge, an IT expert, said searches showed the site was registered to an entity in Pyrmont, but the name was not registered with Asic. There is no publicly listed ABN, and no more information is available.In 2021, the Sun-Herald reported on another website BackBeetaloo.com, an alleged astroturfing campaign in the Beetaloo.No links between BackBeetaloo.com.au and BeetalooEconomicAlliance.com.au have been found.The NT director of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, David Slama, has stated that Appea “had no involvement with this website”.A Tamboran Resources spokesperson said they had no knowledge of the site.\n",

      "Input text: The US navy is covering up dangerous levels of radioactive waste on a 40-acre former shipyard parcel in San Francisco’s waterside Hunters Point neighborhood, public health advocates charge.The land is slated to be turned over to the city as early as next year, and could be used for residential redevelopment. The accusations stem from 2021 navy testing that found 23 samples from the property showed high levels of strontium-90, a radioactive isotope that replaces calcium in bones and causes cancer.The Environmental Protection Agency raised alarm over the levels, but the navy in 2022 said its testing was inaccurate and produced a new set of data that showed levels of strontium-90 lower than zero, which was dismissed by environmental health experts as impossible.The EPA initially said the new testing “reads as if the navy is suppressing data results it doesn’t like”, but the agency has since been silent on the issue, and the Navy’s Office of Inspector General has refused to investigate, said Jeff Ruch, an attorney with the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) nonprofit, which has called on the inspector general to investigate.“It’s like the navy doesn’t care what they say, and we thought it was egregious enough that the IG should look at it,” Ruch said. “Without any external examination, senior navy officials can lie to local officials and the public with impunity, knowing that there will be no negative career consequences.”The navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and in a letter to Peer, the inspector general wrote it would not open an investigation “due to the open ligation”.The 866-acre shipyard once held a secret navy research lab where animals were injected with strontium-90, and some officials suspect the waste was flushed down the drain. The isotope was also used to create glow-in-the-dark paint on the site, and it may have washed off ships used in testing nuclear bombs in the Pacific.The US government in 1989 made the shipyard a “superfund” site – a designation for the nation’s most contaminated lands. Proposition P, passed by more than 86% of San Francisco voters in 2000, requires the shipyard “be cleaned to a level which would enable the unrestricted use of the property – the highest standard for cleanup established by the [EPA]”.However, the navy already turned over one parcel on the site, and residents living there say unremediated contamination is behind a cluster of cancer and other health problems.Complicating the cleanup is rising sea and ground level waters, which threaten to pull the radioactive contamination into the adjacent bay.The navy and US Department of Justice is now engaged in 12 lawsuits related to the site, and the DoJ, which is representing the navy, typically does not want inspector generals to do investigations because they could turn up information that complicates the government’s cases, Ruch said.“That means you have dysfunctional transactions taking place without any sort of review,” he added.Though the EPA initially raised alarm over the strontium-90 test results, it has been silent on the issue in recent months, and has not responded to a Peer Freedom of Information Act Request for emails related to the testing. In response, Peer has sued, asking a judge to order the emails to be turned over.A 2022 memo sent to Peer from the EPA said the agency would rely on caps, or covering up the contaminated land with clean soil, and restrict property use, though that plan violates the provisions of Proposition P, Ruch said.San Francisco mayor London Breed late last year praised the EPA and navy’s cleanup effort, calling it “extensive and thorough” despite the outstanding questions and fears over rising sea levels. That drew condemnation from public health advocates and the San Francisco board of supervisors, which opened an investigation into the issues.For now, it remains unclear which set of test results will guide the next steps.“Given that this land is in queue to be turned over to the city, getting to the bottom of this would be helpful, but that would involve institutional candor which appears to be in short supply,” Ruch said.\n",

      "Input text: Australia’s $528m icebreaking research vessel has suffered another setback and will not resupply the remote Macquarie Island station in coming months as initially planned, with a chartered vessel taking its place.The Romanian-built ship, RSV Nuyina, significantly enhances Australia’s climate research capabilities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean but has endured numerous problems since its delivery in 2021, which itself was delayed by close to a year due to the pandemic.Nuyina’s first voyage to Antarctica in late 2021 was delayed due to problems with its alarm system. Issues were then detected before reaching Casey Station and during repairs to its clutch system months later, the manufacturer Damen determined the shaft couplings needed replacing.Self-driving sleds? Australian scientists look to robots to delve deeper into AntarcticaRead moreThe Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) had planned for Nuyina to refuel the remote Macquarie Island station in March, while collecting returning expeditioners, but the division has confirmed that will now be done by the chartered icebreaker Aiviq.“Like all new and complex ships, Nuyina will require time for commissioning as it prepares to serve Australia’s Antarctic and Southern Ocean science efforts in the decades ahead,” an AAD spokesperson said.“While Nuyina was due to return to Australia in March, it is now expected to return in April and as part of contingency planning, Aiviq will undertake the Macquarie Island voyage.“Aiviq may also be available for a later voyage to the island as a contingency.”\n",

      "Guardian Australia has been told the switch from Nuyina to the smaller Aiviq will delay some scientific research on Macquarie Island, due to a lack of accommodation onboard. The AAD did not respond to questions about the impact on research.The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said the public deserved more transparency about who was paying for ongoing repairs and how scientific research had been impacted by the ship’s absence.“Australia’s multimillion-dollar icebreaker only hit the water in late 2021 yet has spent about as much time in maintenance and repairs as it has servicing Australia’s Antarctic science missions,” Whish-Wilson said.“The AAD has been chronically under-resourced by successive federal governments for decades resulting in fragmented Antarctic research and uncertainty in the science community.“A plagued $528m expedition ship is the last thing the fragile Antarctic Division needs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An AAD spokesperson confirmed the vessel would also remain under warranty “for the duration of maintenance in Singapore”.When the AAD realised Nuyina would be unavailable for the majority of the summer period, it chartered the 110-metre US icebreaking vessel Aiviq as a replacement, for an undisclosed cost. The 157-metre Dutch-flagged cargo ship Happy Dragon was also chartered.The Aiviq may not be available on a long-term basis, with the US Coast Guard reportedly interested in chartering it from Alaska later this year.Nuyina, named after an Indigenous word for southern lights, contains a unique 13-metre “moon pool”, allowing robot craft to be deployed through the hull.On top of built-in laboratories, it can be fitted with modular labs in shipping containers. It replaces the icebreaker Aurora Australis, which retired from its role in March 2020 after 30 years.The ship’s delivery was cited as a key moment for the AAD in director Kim Ellis’s resignation letter to staff on Monday evening.“The last four years have been some of the most challenging for the division; a global pandemic, the end of service for the Aurora Australis, the introduction of new contingent shipping and the Nuyina, two machinery of government changes, a new direction for science and operations, and the major changes created by the sustainable funding review and its implementation,” Ellis wrote.\n",

      "Input text: A closed-off beach that will have so few swimmers that it won’t be patrolled this summer is among 51 to have controversial shark nets installed by the New South Wales government, despite opposition.The state’s Department of Primary Industries began rolling out the nets at beaches between Newcastle and Wollongong on Friday, a fortnight after the Minns government announced it would continue the controversial shark meshing program.The DPI has confirmed a net will be installed at Garie beach, south of Sydney, despite pleas from environmental groups to reconsider, given the only road to the isolated site has been closed indefinitely to cars and pedestrians after being damaged by a landslide during floods last March.Shark nets to return to NSW beaches despite calls from councils to abolish practice Read moreEnvironmentalists Emilia Michael and Lauren Sandeman wrote to the head of the shark management program in August asking them to pause the meshing program at Garie beach, noting that surf life saving patrols had been suspended there.“Garie beach is only accessible by 60-90 minute one way [via] grade 4-5 hiking trails in the royal national park. This means Garie beach is extremely difficult to access for the general public,” they wrote.From 2012 through to last summer, the shark net at Garie Beach has caught 20 target sharks and 109 non-target marine animals, and no target shark was caught last season, they wrote.A department official wrote back on Thursday and said: “As the minister announced last Monday, there will be no changes to the shark meshing program that starts tomorrow, with all 51 nets scheduled to go back in the water.”\n",

      "Emma Hurst, an Animal Justice party MP, said the “lazy” decision showed the Minns government was proceeding with the “status quo” without considering whether shark nets were actually needed.“You can’t protect beachgoers from a shark attack from a beach that is closed to the public – this is ludicrous,” Hurst said.Dr Chris Pepin-Neff, a public policy lecturer at the University of Sydney, said Garie beach was a “great metaphor” for the effectiveness of shark nets and that the Minns government’s “zero risk” approach to shark mitigation was “folly”.“I appreciate their point that they want to phase out shark nets when the technology is right, but beach safety in NSW needs to be based in reality,” he said.“The reality is there is no decision that the government will make that will determine if a shark will bite you in the ocean or not.”The installation of the shark nets for this summer comes a week after 44-year-old surfer Toby Begg was attacked by a great white shark at Lighthouse Beach in Port Macquarie on the state’s mid-north coast.Proponents of shark nets point out that there has only been one fatality from a shark at a netted beach since the meshing program began in 1937. They want the nets to remain in place to protect swimmers, at least until modern deterrents such as drones and Smart drumlines are more advanced.Environmental groups strongly oppose the nets because other animals, including threatened species, can become trapped in them and die.Several coastal councils and a chorus of NSW MPs, including Liberals, Greens and crossbenchers, have all recently voiced their opposition to the nets, arguing they do not protect swimmers and take too great a toll on marine life. Data published last month by the state government showed almost 90% of animals caught in the nets over the past year were non-target species such as turtles, rays and dolphins.The department and the state’s agriculture minister, Tara Moriarty, have been contacted for comment.On Friday the premier, Chris Minns, said calls from opponents to use technology such as drumlines were laudable but the measures were not advanced enough to replace nets.“If you look at the alternatives that are available on Sydney beaches, they’re not going to be as effective as existing shark nets in place,” he said.\n",

      "Input text: Three caves hewn into the rocky coastline of Dorset that are the bat equivalent of a speed-dating site, attracting crowds of the flying mammals from as far as 40 miles away, have been acquired by the National Trust.The bats gather at Winspit caves near Swanage in the late summer and early autumn, dart around the cliffs and, if all goes well, find a mate from a different colony.The National Trust said on Monday it had acquired the farmland that included the three caves, plus one inland.“It’s effectively a big party when the bats arrive,” said David Brown, the National Trust ecologist for Purbeck. “They fly huge distances to favourite spots like this, mixing with bats from other colonies. The caves are also perfect for the bats to roost in, full of nooks and crannies.”Fifteen species of bats had been recorded on the 350-acre Weston Farm site on the South Purbeck coast, making it Dorset’s most important “swarming site” – and one of national importance – with bats flying in from across the county and even farther afield to meet and mate on the wing.The bats sweep into the three cliff caves – created by quarrying for Purbeck stone – from the seaside. They can also dart into another inland cave also created by quarrying. Brown said this “speed-dating” was important to ensure the genetic health of bat populations.Among the creatures that are found there are the rare serotine and barbastelle bats. The caves are also used for winter hibernation for some of the UK’s rarest bats, such as the greater horseshoe.The land forms the eastern half of St Aldhem’s Head, and will extend the existing trust-owned “Purbeck Wares”, an important habitat for orchids and other wildflowers. The coastal strip includes ancient “strip lynchet” terraced field systems.Brown added: “We aim to create a landscape that is richer in nature, so there’ll be no chemical inputs or regular ploughing on any of the land and life will be restored to the soil using natural regenerative farming methods. As the land is given time to rest and recover, the ground will store more carbon and streams flowing off the land will be cleaner and healthier.”Over the coming years, the farm, which has been in the same family for more than 100 years and through three generations, is to be transformed into a mosaic of species-rich grasslands, wildflower meadows, scrub and woodlands.Conservation grazing of the grasslands sloping down to the coast should bring back plants such as the green-winged and early spider orchids.Restored meadows on the former arable fields will hopefully bloom with cowslips and knapweeds, and these flower-rich grasslands will become home to rare butterflies such as the Lulworth skipper and adonis blue. This will also open up nesting sites for endangered skylarks.Hedgerows, scrub and small woodland patches are intended to give refuge to voles and other mammals, and create breeding sites for birds including yellowhammers and linnets. This stretch of coastline is also the summer pit-stop for visiting birds such as whitethroats.As well as being good for bats, the trust says it will improve access for human visitors. Brown said: “In the future people will enjoy fantastic uninterrupted access along a 7km stretch of some of the UK’s best coastline, and be free to explore some its most diverse and ecologically rich grasslands.”\n",

Jeez.”He was reassuring, and ran through the options for HRT. It can, of course, be life-changing for some women. But as I considered the various oestrogen patches and gels, a different unease grew. Hormones or hormone-mimicking chemicals can be powerfully disruptive to the body, and in aquatic systems cause female marine snails to grow penises and the feminisation of male fish. Sewage treatment is able to strip oestrogens from domestic effluent, but that’s limited comfort given the institutional negligence of our water industry. Besides, I swim in rivers and lakes. Doing so has a borderline miraculous effect on my wellbeing – and that of thousands of older women. How many swim slathered in hormone gel? I balked. Sometimes it’s just all too bloody complicated.‘I started making daily clover tea and nettle porridge.’ Photograph: Amy Jane BeerWith typical discretion, my friend Maria, a forager and herbalist, proffered the information that red clover flowers are full of phytoestrogens and nettle seeds are amazing for hair and skin. Both plants are abundant locally – the clover having been sown as a soil improver. It carries in nodes on its roots near-miraculous bacterial factories that convert atmospheric nitrogen into nitrate at a rate of about 250kg per hectare a year – an ecosystem service that greatly reduces the need for synthetic fertiliser (good news for farmers, as the price is rocketing).I started making daily clover tea and nettle porridge. My biology background demanded that I also read around. I learned that the hormone-stabilising effects of red clover are, thus far, scientifically indistinguishable from placebo, with the familiar caveat that “more research is needed”. But a strong placebo effect is still an effect. If it helps – and a month in, it seems to – does it matter? My inspiration comes from nearby nature; the possibility that it might also give me back the words to respond to it, free, is profoundly appealing. Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary\n",

      "Input text: A young activist who campaigned with the climate groups Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil has been found dead after going missing almost a week ago.Xavier Gonzalez-Trimmer, 22, was found in Richmond Park on Monday. Family and friends had been searching the area.He had been a key protester with Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil, and had been arrested 16 times in relation to protest actions, with five hearings on different charges coming up this year.Next month he was due to stand trial at Inner London crown court accused of causing a public nuisance, one of more than 50 trials of Insulate Britain supporters due to take place at that court this year.Xavi Gonzalez-Trimmer standing on top of a Metropolitan police van during an Insulate Britain protest in Parliament Square, Westminster, in November 2021. Photograph: Damien Gayle/The GuardianA missing person poster circulated on social media by friends said Gonzalez-Trimmer had left home on 15 February, with his bicycle but without his ID, wallet or any cash. By Monday, searches had focused on Richmond Park after his bicycle was found there.News of Gonzalez-Trimmer’s death spread quickly among activists. Giovanna Lewis, an Insulate Britain supporter, said he was loved by all in their movement.“He was beautiful and he was tall and handsome,” she said. “He had a big smile and the smile just flooded out of him. That was the man that Xavier was. He was special.”The Metropolitan police said it had received a report on 16 February that Gonzalez-Trimmer had gone missing, and that officers had made inquiries to try to locate him.“On 20 February, the body of a man was found in Richmond Park – the death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner,” the force said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

      "Input text: Two miles off the Llŷn peninsula in Wales lies Bardsey Island, an exposed, rocky landmass 1.5 miles long and just over 0.5 miles at its widest point. Bardsey mountain rises over almost half of the island, with a height of 167 metres and rare lichen species found at the top. It’s only reachable by boat and has just 12 properties, one being Bardsey Bird and Field Observatory – my home for the week.I’m here for a university birders week, and on a clear, mild and slightly windy night – a relief given how strong the wind can get here – we head out into the darkness to look for a rarely seen and fascinating species.As we walk along the gravel track, our gaze is fixed on the incredible night sky. There is so little light pollution here that the island was recently designated as Europe’s first dark sky sanctuary. Even the Milky Way is visible with the naked eye.The shores of Bardsey Island, a place nearly 30,000 manx shearwaters call home. Photograph: Picasa/Robert PowellDark silhouettes glide overhead, sounding like squeaky dog toys. As we wander towards a grassy stone wall, I see a black and white medium-sized bird sitting on the top. Then another, and another. These are Manx shearwaters, a seabird of the open ocean. Nearly 30,000 of these birds call Bardsey home, nesting in burrows and thriving due to the lack of ground predators.We are helping with a long-term scheme to ring and monitor these birds. Steve Stansfield, director of operations at the observatory, explains how to put on a metal ring, each with a unique number to help us to track and identify each individual. In autumn they will migrate to the South Atlantic, mostly off Brazil and Argentina, with the last juveniles leaving in late September or early October; they’ll arrive back here in late March next year. A Manx shearwater that nested on the island in 2008 was shown by its ring to be over 50 years old, and would have flown around 5m miles in its lifetime.These ones are adults; at night-time they like to sit on and around the walls near to their burrows. During the day, when we ring the juveniles, we have to put our hands down the burrows and carefully take them out.As I carefully attach the ring with Steve’s help, I think about all the phenomenal landscapes it has seen. Placing it back where it was found, I wish it good luck. Who knows – it might just make it to 50.

      "Input text: Researchers hunting for an endangered turtle have discovered something even rarer – a white platypus frolicking in a New South Wales stream.Photos and footage of the extraordinary creature have been published in a scientific journal after several encounters over the past two years or so.The University of New England PhD student Lou Streeting was searching a Northern Tablelands stream for endangered western saw-shelled turtles when she first spotted the conspicuous enigma in early 2021.Environmentalists condemn Australia’s ‘woeful record’ after 48 plants and animals added to threatened species listRead moreUNE researchers have discovered a rare white platypus living in a stream in northern NSW.“It surfaced literally a few metres away from us and we were like ‘Wow, did we just see a white platypus?’” Streeting says.“I was glad I caught it on video because I didn’t think anyone would believe me otherwise.”She has seen the platypus a number of times since then, most recently three months ago, showing it is coping with its lack of camouflage.A platypus with a point of differenceWhite platypuses have been documented in the past, but this one has a point of difference.It’s not an albino because only part of its body is affected by an absence of melanin – a pigment that gives colour to fur, skin and eyes.\n",

      "“It does have some pigmentation. It has a black bill, and it has black feet and a little bit of colour on its tail. So we’ve said it’s a leucistic platypus.”And it’s possibly the first one ever documented.The ultra-rare platypus has a white body, a black bill, black feet and a little bit of colour on its tail. Photograph: Lou Streeting/PR Image“Our search of scientific literature, newspapers, and databases yielded 12 individual records of albino or atypically white platypus dating back to the first record in 1835, and our observation likely represents the only known record of a leucistic platypus.”Streeting hopes the intriguing discovery will remind everyone of the need to protect the treasure trove of native species in the nation’s waterways.“These environments are not just home to endangered species like the western saw-shelled turtle, but also to other truly unique and extraordinary creatures like this rare white platypus.”Habitat destruction fuels decline in numbersThe Australian Conservation Foundation says platypus numbers are in decline, with the duck-billed, egg-laying, milk-producing yet nippleless peculiarity losing roughly a quarter of its habitat during the past 30 years.Despite the downward trajectory, there’s a lack of good data and only broad estimates of how many are left.In an effort to plug the gaps, the ACF has partnered with the University of NSW’s Centre for Ecosystem Science on a citizen science initiative called the Platy-project.The platypus isn’t an albino because only part of its body is affected by a lack of melanin.It encourages Australians to look for them in local creeks and rivers, and share the details of any sightings.Could platypuses disappear in Australia?The UNSW conservation ecologist Gilad Bino worked on a 2021 national assessment of the conservation status of the platypus and says there’s much uncertainty about how many are left.It could sit anywhere between 50,000 and 300,000.There are no national or state-level monitoring frameworks for the species despite evidence of shrinking populations in places such as greater Melbourne.“That would be true for all urban areas, but we don’t have the data,” he says.Populations are also in decline in parts of the Murray-Darling river system, and there have been localised extinctions in Brisbane.“In South Australia, they are pretty much extinct except for an introduced population on Kangaroo Island and even they’ve been impacted by bushfires and drought,” he says.“I don’t think platypuses are going to disappear – and I hope I’m right – in the next several decades. But what I do fear is that for many people across Australia, they’re going to see them disappear from their local rivers.”\n",

      "Input text: The British Museum is facing demands to remove BP’s name from its lecture theatre to send a “powerful message” about fossil fuel sponsorship.The museum did not renew its deal with the energy firm  this year after 27 years of BP funding exhibitions and other activities.The move was welcomed by environmental campaigners and came after other cultural institutions cut ties with sponsors that were causing reputational damage.Now, more than 80 people from heritage, arts and climate backgrounds have called on Hartwig Fischer, the museum’s director, to remove BP’s name from the lecture theatre before he steps down next year.The signatories include photographer Nan Goldin, who led a campaign to get the Sackler name removed from museums across the world; climate scientist Bill McGuire; writer Gaia Vince; climate justice activist and mental health advocate Tori Tsui; the director of the Brunel Museum, Katherine McAlpine; and archaeologist and co-author of The Dawn of Everything, David Wengrow.In their letter to Fischer, they say: “Just as cultural institutions around the world have removed the Sackler family name as evidence of the harmful ways their money was made came to light, the damning evidence of BP’s past – and present – can no longer be ignored.“Renaming the lecture theatre would send a powerful message about the future the museum wants to see … You would be demonstrating the kind of climate leadership that is now so urgently needed.”The lecture theatre seats more than 300 people, with a raised stage and cinema-style screen. It is available for hire for events including AGMs, awards ceremonies, conferences and screenings.In June, it emerged that the museum had decided that no further exhibitions or other activities would be sponsored by BP. It said there were “no other contracts or agreements in effect between the museum and BP”.The Tate, National Portrait Gallery, Royal Shakespeare Company, Scottish Ballet and Royal Opera House have ended funding partnerships with the energy firm in recent years.BP has been a sponsor of the British Museum since 1996. The most recent five-year contract expired in February, but the British Museum and BP would not be drawn on whether their partnership was over.In disclosures obtained under freedom of information requests by lawyers acting for the campaign group Culture Unstained, the museum said “certain terms” of the deal remained in effect, because it had verbally agreed to let BP exercise its “supporter benefits” until the end of 2023.The letter to Fischer, which was organised by Culture Unstained, said: “We welcome the news that the British Museum’s existing sponsorship deal with the oil and gas company BP formally ended in February and has not been renewed.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He said he wanted to focus on the “rescue and preservation of cultural heritage in times of climate crisis, conflict, war, and violence”.Last week, BP reported profits of $2.6bn (£2bn) for the second quarter of the year, as the world experienced extreme heatwaves caused by the climate crisis.Campaigners have accused oil companies of making “obscene” profits at the expense of the environment.A spokesperson for the British Museum declined to comment.\n",

      "Input text: There will be many reasons why Britain’s energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, went public with her unease about “serious and concerning” allegations raised by the Guardian this week over cybersecurity, site safety and a “toxic” workplace culture in Sellafield. There was the “longstanding nature” of the matters in question, raising questions over the site’s management. Neighbouring governments have had serious concerns. The plant holds enough plutonium to potentially make thousands of atomic bombs of the size that obliterated Japan’s Nagasaki in 1945. By asking for assurances from its state-controlled owner and its regulator, Ms Coutinho emphasises that effective governance of Britain’s nuclear industry is a critical issue.This is a sensible response to these scandals. The cabinet minister is right to publicise her concerns about a hazardous industry that can inflict catastrophic environmental damage and deaths. She has sent a helpful signal about valuing public safety over secrecy. Sellafield in Cumbria, and about 20 smaller sites, need to be monitored and protected, as the waste stored can remain radioactive for tens of thousands of years. Yet the nuclear establishment is at best opaque. Britain’s postwar development of nuclear weapons grew alongside the construction of nuclear energy reactors. The industry’s military connections have influenced its approaches to corporate governance for the worse.There is an urgent problem of nuclear waste disposal. Britain was one of the first economies to generate nuclear energy. But that meant radioactive waste has been left for decades without a permanent storage solution. This has seen the cost of temporary storage soar and the risk of catastrophe increase. Sellafield is one of the most dangerous places in the world, a notoriety bolstered by crumbling buildings and tanks leaking irradiated sludge. It is no stranger to trouble, going as far as changing its name to distance itself from being the site of one of history’s worst nuclear accidents in 1957.The consensus today for an enduring answer is to bury nuclear waste deep underground in “geological disposal facilities”. Finland will open one next year. Its spent nuclear fuel will be packed in copper canisters, and these entombed in the bedrock on the Gulf of Bothnia at a depth of 400m. France and Sweden are pursuing similar schemes. Britain has homed in on three sites, but finding an area willing to host a £53bn underground dump is not easy, given public safety concerns.It would be better to have cheap, green energy that doesn’t create toxic waste. But demand for electricity is growing, and – without the battery technology to effectively store energy – this will have to be met at times when there is no sun or wind. Hence countries aim to use nuclear energy to try to cut fossil fuel dependence. But, say experts, ambitious government targets for more nuclear power stations could see Britain run out of room to store the radioactive waste produced. Opportunities arise too. Half of the world’s 420 nuclear reactors will need dismantling by 2050. Sellafield is at the heart of a billion-pound UK decommissioning industry. Its expertise could be sold worldwide. But that relies on a reputation for safety and competence, something that Ms Coutinho’s intervention doubtless seeks to salvage.\n",

      "Input text: The 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow was based on the idea that the main north Atlantic Ocean current could slow and then reverse, superstorms would flash-freeze the northern hemisphere and a new ice age would abruptly descend. It was dismissed as “profoundly silly”, “a ludicrous popcorn thriller” informed by “lousy science”, and some scientists argued it depicted meteorological phenomena “as occurring over days, instead of decades or centuries”.Storm Elliott, the “bomb cyclone” that hit the US over the holidays, should have made some of those critics uncomfortable. Temperatures in places plunged in just a few minutes as one of the greatest North American storms ever recorded swept down from the Arctic to Mexico, sometimes at hurricane speed. It brought death, chaos and misery for tens of millions of people.Fierce Christmas storms and bomb cyclones are not that unusual in the US but Elliott was remarkable chiefly for its continental scale, lightning speed and intensity. Scientists have yet to calculate the degree to which it might be linked to human actions and increased CO2 levels, but it clearly fits the IPCC’s widely predicted pattern of climate intensification and unprecedented global heat, cold and atmospheric turbulence.Less noticed than Storm Elliott but possibly just as significant were the disastrous Christmas floods in the Philippines and Brazil, and the worryingly warm holiday period experienced across much of Europe in the past 10 days. Temperatures of more than 26C were recorded in France, Spain and Italy, with many Alpine ski resorts closed for lack of snow as rain fell and temperatures climbed 15C above normal. Traditionally, it’s Australians who spend Christmas on the beach. Soon it might be anyone.00:01:48The footage that captures how dangerously cold it is in the US right now – video reportThe cyclone bomb rounded off a year that rewrote climate history. It was not just one of the hottest years on record, but also one of the driest in many countries, with nearly every week bringing some new climate-related disaster. Starting with Storm Eunice in February, which battered northern Europe, immense floods, droughts and storms hit Pakistan, India, China, Australia, southern Africa and the US. Crops failed in unprecedented heatwaves and hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless in both rich and poor countries. Temperature records stretching back hundreds of years were broken in the UK, Italy, France and Spain.Next year is widely predicted by meteorologists to bring more of the same intensification of weather. The Met Office says 2022 will be the newest warmest year on record. Greenland’s glaciers have been found to be melting far faster than previously thought, heatwaves are becoming more common and storms are expected to become more powerful as the oceans continue to warm.But while 2022 may have been the year that more people than ever experienced what used to be termed “freak” weather, it was yet another year lost when it comes to governments acting. What Storm Elliott and all the droughts, floods and extreme climate events show is that we are physically, mentally and financially unprepared for what is certain to come. Christian Aid this week estimated that 2022’s 10 worst climate disasters alone cost more than $165bn, but that is likely to be nothing if action to adapt our infrastructure and economies is not taken urgently.The Guardian view on the climate crisis: no end in sight | EditorialRead moreEven as Storm Elliott devastated parts of the US, it must have occurred to many governments in the rich northern hemisphere that the climate crisis is helping to supercharge the weather and that something similar or worse could just as easily happen in their countries.But the rich world has utterly failed to adapt to the changes taking place, and it will now cost far more than it need have done. Only a handful of countries – mostly those on the frontline of climate chaos like Bangladesh – have even begun to try to adapt to the approaching chaos and tragedy. Cop27 in Egypt may have finally launched a global loss and damage fund to help poor nations adapt, but no money has been pledged and, judging from experience, is likely to come soon.All we know is that major adverse weather events such as Elliott are likely to grow in number, scale and frequency. That means big decisions must be taken now on how to adapt our investments, housing, farming, food, transport, health and energy systems.Governments cannot avoid the climate crisis any longer. We must become accustomed to this new reality and be prepared. We have no choice now; everything must change.\n",

      "Input text: Dear winter,It seems that you intend to visit us again this year. I just want to make it clear – because researchers have found that expressing “feelings” about you in the form of a “dear winter” letter could make me less miserable at this time of year – that I did not invite you.Don’t take it personally, but I am sure not many other people are keen on your arrival either, apart from heat pump marketers and pantomime performers. The thing is, winter, 2 million people in the UK experience seasonal affective disorder – and it’s all your fault.I didn’t always have a problem with you. As a child in Scotland, I remember the sense of exhilaration and excitement at the prospect of frozen lochs, blizzards and the hope that school might be closed. This was only enhanced by the fact that my father, who was born and brought up in Calcutta, now Kolkata, had never seen snow until he was 25 and greeted every fresh dusting with wonder.But that was then. Now, I see you coming each year, perfumed with bonfire smoke and cinnamon-spiced apples, lulling me into a feeling of cosy optimism.“Oh, it’s not so bad, this winter malarkey,” I will tell myself. Now, I can enjoy flannel pyjamas, hot chocolate with marshmallows and watch three seasons of Lupin (because there is nothing more comforting than scaring yourself on a dead-of-winter night with a foreign crime thriller). Distracted by luxury Advent calendars stuffed with artisanal cheese and craft gin, I think you are my friend. Until, suddenly, it’s January.Behold the true depths of your soul – dark, grinch-like, unrelenting, with a side order of guilt, bills and self-assessment tax forms. And you still have one more trick up your sleeve, don’t you, winter? Every year, I think: if I can just get to the end of January, it will be spring. But, like an ultramarathon runner, you have the stamina to keep pace with the shivering gloom until the end of March.No wonder a team of researchers at the University of Glasgow (whose main building is often mistaken for that fictional wintery paradise Hogwarts) have written a guidebook to help people cope with the season. Light is a Right: A Guide to Wintering Well may not contain magic, but it does make some creative suggestions.As well as writing a letter to you – strangely, the book doesn’t include your address – it suggests making a cardboard frame to look through and thus focus mindfully on one patch of sky at a time (who needs Netflix?). My favourite suggestion, because of its cinematic vibe, involves visualising a medieval room filled with light, stained glass and mirrors. “Think surfaces, shiny things, mirrors, silver paper, glitter, [a] neon lamp, candles … papercuts on windows … Wish more of the outside world in, happier habits, cosy joys, enjoyable hobbies …. Do the achievable and available, as opposed to the ideal and impossible.”Similar inspiration is to be found in Katherine May’s excellent book Wintering, which became an unexpected bestseller during lockdown. She mentions that a surprising number of novels and fairytales have winter as a backdrop, but believes acceptance rather than fantasy is the way to maintain wellbeing until spring.“You’re not going to avoid winter, so you might as well embrace it,” she advises. “I know people who hate it so much they try not to do anything for the whole season. We can invest so much energy in flinching away from things we find unpleasant or don’t want to happen, but acceptance and stepping towards them lessens the pain.”I think she may be suggesting that I offer you an olive branch, dear winter. How might I do that? The Glasgow research closes with a line from the Edwin Morgan poem Grey, which urges us to see some good in the gloom. “This moment, this day, so grey, so plain, so pleasing in its way!” It’s a big ask, to try to embrace life with only an occasional burst of sunshine. But I will let you in on a secret. The simple act of writing this letter has made me feel a lot less gloomy about the prospect of your arrival.Yours sincerely,Anita Anita Chaudhuri is a freelance journalist and photographer\n",

      "Input text: Tornadoes affected several US states on Friday – particularly Iowa, Illinois, Arkansas and Tennessee – causing significant damage and a number of fatalities. It has been a fairly active year for tornadoes so far, with a preliminary total of 385 across the US as of 2 April, and that is likely to increase this week. An upper-level low will move slowly east across the US, while at lower levels an area of low pressure moves north-east from the central Rockies towards the Great Lakes.Warm, moist air is expected to be drawn northward through much of the eastern half of the US. Severe thunderstorms are anticipated, with parts of the south and lower midwest likely to be affected again. The strongest storms are expected on Tuesday, when supercells – the rotating thunderstorms responsible for many tornadoes – are likely. The National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center is warning of the potential for strong tornadoes and damaging straight-line winds.The Canary Islands had an exceptionally hot end to March, with temperatures widely rising above 34C (93F) on Wednesday and Thursday. The state meteorological agency (AEMET) issued an orange weather warning for temperatures exceeding 37C – the first time this has happened in March. The Tasarte weather station in La Aldea de San Nicolás recorded 37.8C on Wednesday, breaking a 72-year-old March temperature record. The new record stood for just one day, before the same site recorded 38.2C on Thursday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

There was a mini heatwave last weekend, with temperatures in the south pole above -40C for more than two days and reaching a high of -33C. Though shy of the record high for March, this was 20 degrees above the seasonal average of -53.7C. Daily highs exceeded -40C once again this weekend. The cause of the unusually high temperatures is thought to be variations in the path of the southern polar jet stream – a rapid air current flowing around the Antarctic region – driving parcels of warm and moist air farther south than normal. Antarctic heatwaves are uncommon but are occurring more frequently as the climate warms. Antarctic sea temperatures are unusually warm this year, with in recent months some of the lowest sea ice levels ever recorded, and this could be another contributing factor to the heatwave. Forecasts suggest parts of Antarctica could continue to have temperatures 20C or more above average into late April.\n",

      "A spokesperson said the Coalition had listened to the community.“The concerns raised by the community in relation to bushfire, critical infrastructure and density of the application cannot be overlooked,” the spokesperson said.Opponents of the plan argued the development was a bushfire risk and that the site should be saved and protected.The land council insisted it had fire mitigation plans, that the site was damaged already due to prior use and the project would be done in a way that protected biodiversity.Federation University’s professor of Indigenous studies, Dennis Foley, said the land needed protection.“This land is so important for the ecology of the northern beaches,” he said.“It has a lot of spiritual connection not only to us, but also to the non-Indigenous families in the area. That’s why they are fighting so hard to protect it.”The federal independent Mackellar MP, Sophie Scamps, also said there was overwhelming community opposition to the project.“It wouldn’t matter who is proposing this, whether it be the MLALC, a commercial property developer or a local business – the community and I would oppose it for multiple reasons,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "Input text: New Zealand’s heavy reliance on planting trees to offset carbon pollution threatens to torpedo the country’s ambitious plans to reach net zero emissions by 2050, according to warnings from the body advising the government on its climate policy direction.The independent Climate Commission published draft guidance on Wednesday that – when finalised later this year – must be considered by New Zealand’s leaders as they draw up their next suite of plans to meet the country’s greenhouse gas reduction targets.The provisional document sounded renewed alarm about the government’s inclusion of carbon offsets through forestry in its calculation of emissions reduction, and a lack of clarity on how much meeting climate goals should be made up of real cuts to high-polluting activities.New Zealand’s government “needs to make a choice about how far it will go” in directly cutting polluting activities versus simply planting trees to remove carbon, the report said. If it did not, New Zealand would fail to reach net zero emissions by 2050, the writers added.“Our current pathway of policies will not get us there,” the chair of the commission, Rod Carr, told reporters in Wellington on Wednesday.New Zealand scraps transport emissions reform to fund welfare increaseRead moreHis remarks struck a cautious note a year after New Zealand’s Labour government unveiled the most sweeping and ambitious plan to reduce emissions in the country’s history, with a policy programme that included dozens of proposed actions.Jacinda Ardern, then New Zealand’s prime minister, said when she announced the plan – which was also based on the Commission’s advice – that the climate crisis was a matter of “life or death”. A law passed by her government enshrines in law the target of net zero emissions and a reduction in biogenic methane emissions by 24%-47% by 2050.New Zealand has built a global brand through its presentation as a “clean, green” paradise. But while the agricultural country of 5 million’s share of global greenhouse gas emissions is small, its gross emissions per capita are high and it has been one of the world’s worst performers on emission increases.Emissions in New Zealand rose 57% between 1990 and 2018 – the second-greatest increase of all industrialised countries.Chris Hipkins, who replaced Ardern as prime minister in January, has also rolled back a raft of climate change policies as he focuses on “bread and butter issues” ahead of October’s general election.Cattle on shore of Lake Wakatipu, New Zealand. The agricultural country of 5 million has one of the world’s highest rates of greenhouse gas emissions per capita. Photograph: David Clapp/Getty ImagesThe commission’s establishment under a cross-partisan agreement in New Zealand’s parliament in 2019 means that the government must, by law, consider its recommendations on climate policy direction, no matter which party is in power. The commission’s latest advice will guide what initiatives are chosen to achieve New Zealand’s 2026-2030 emissions targets.“We need to pick up the pace and policy needs to be aligned with the statutory targets … that have already been put in place,” Carr said. The document was not an assessment of the government’s emission reduction efforts to date, which will be published in 2024, he added.The law governing New Zealand’s greenhouse gas reduction targets does not limit how much carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere through planting trees can be relied upon to declare success in slashing emissions.“A lack of clarity on the approach to achieve net zero … emissions by 2050 and beyond is likely to create ongoing policy uncertainty and impact decision-making in the public and private sectors,” the report said.Is driving on the left stopping New Zealand reaching its climate goals? | Henry CookeRead moreAny delay in beginning the work of true emissions reduction would make the transition to a lower-carbon economy more costly and disruptive, Carr said, and achieving a net reduction in emissions primarily through planting trees would be impossible to sustain in the long term. Forests could be destroyed though fire or extreme weather and they do not store carbon forever, he added.Every time a tree was planted to offset pollution, he said, “we’re committing New Zealanders to maintaining that forest cover for a very long time.”The government’s first emissions reduction plan pledged subsidies for electric vehicles; New Zealand has one of the oldest and dirtiest transport fleets in the developed world and the government plans to make zero-emissions vehicles 30% of the light vehicle fleet by 2035. It also vowed to end the country’s reliance on fossil fuels, lower agricultural emissions, and reduce waste going to landfill.The commission is now seeking public consultation on its latest advice and will issue final guidance later this year.\n",

      "Input text: Ministers are preparing to allow new houses to continue to be fitted with gas boilers, long after they were supposed to be phased out, campaigners fear.A loophole being considered for the forthcoming future homes standard, a housing regulation in England intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from newly built homes in line with the net zero target, would allow new homes to be fitted with “hydrogen-ready” boilers.However, experts have told the Guardian that these are functionally not much different from standard gas boilers. “Hydrogen-ready” boilers can be used with fossil fuel gas, of the kind used by most of the UK’s existing housing stock, and experts fear they are unlikely ever to use hydrogen, as many studies have shown that hydrogen is likely to be too expensive, and face too many technical challenges, to be widely used for home heating.Airbus boss warns of delay in decarbonising airline industryRead moreThis means that stipulating that such “hydrogen-ready” boilers could be fitted in new homes, instead of genuinely low-carbon heating such as heat pumps, would risk tying millions of households into fossil fuel use for the long-term, and imperil the UK’s commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050.Fitting gas boilers, including “hydrogen-ready” boilers, at a cost of about £2,000 each, is cheaper for housing developers than fitting heat pumps, which can cost more than £5,000 for developers to install and £12,000 for households.A group of more than 40 organisations has written to ministers asking for the potential loophole to be closed. Ministers are to consult on the future homes standard from next month, and it will take effect from 2025.Juliet Phillips, of the E3G thinktank, who organised the letter, said: “Connecting new built homes to the gas grid, during a gas crisis, is a disaster for energy bills, energy security, and the climate emergency. Experts have repeatedly concluded that hydrogen will not provide a nationwide solution for heat decarbonisation.”She said: “Hydrogen-ready boilers could act as a wolf in sheep’s clothing, allowing new homes to be connected to the gas grid, with little chance they will be supplied with green hydrogen anytime soon. We encourage the government to instead firmly double down on readily available clean tech solutions such as heat pumps.”The letter calls on ministers to ensure there are no new connections allowed to the gas grid, under the future homes standard. It notes that heat pumps are an established technology, along with low-carbon heat networks that use a central source such as geothermal heat.“There is a risk that allowing hydrogen-ready boilers to be installed could create a loophole which would allow new homes to be connected to the gas grid and burn fossil fuels for years to come,” the signatories write. “100% hydrogen for heating is not yet a tried and tested technology, and unlikely to be available for decades, and even then unlikely to be economic as a nationwide solution for domestic heat decarbonisation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We encourage the UK government to take a strategic approach to the development and deployment of hydrogen, focusing on the sectors where it presents the most effective pathway to net zero.”About 14% of the UK’s emissions come from home heating, but there have been few initiatives to reduce this. Insulation and switching people from gas boilers to heat pumps are regarded as the most effective means of reducing emissions, but central government currently has no scheme offering incentives for insulation to most households, and the boiler upgrade scheme for heat pumps has been undersubscribed.\n",

      "Input text: The reduction in government support for companies’ energy bills could threaten their efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions, a leading consultancy has warned.The Treasury announced on Monday that it plans to slash the support available to “non-domestic” energy customers – including businesses, schools, hospitals and charities – from April in a bid to reduce the cost to the government.Business groups immediately warned that the significant cuts could threaten firms’ survival with costs likely to stay high this year in comparison to prices before the energy crisis began in 2021.New energy bills support package for business is not finely targeted, but broadly reasonable | Nils PratleyRead moreThe leading energy consultancy Cornwall Insight warned on Tuesday that, as well as the effects on business earnings and cashflow, the cut to support could curb businesses’ ability to invest in decarbonisation.Gareth Miller, its chief executive, said: “Aside from the impact on the financial integrity of businesses, the government must also weigh up the constraints on capacity of the UK business sector to invest significantly in the decarbonisation of business and industry.“Ultimately, decarbonising industry and business requires investment of ever larger volumes of capital as the decade progresses.”Miller said that some larger firms will still be able to implement their plans but many “may now be unable to create borrowing capacity or free cashflow, at least over the coming few years, while they face this cocktail of cost challenges”.“It’s not about the will, it’s about the means. If the government is going to reduce direct support for business energy bills, then perhaps the policy focus should turn to how they can offset this by using tax and investment incentives, the design of energy markets, and greater financial reward for the demand side, allowing businesses to offset financial pressures, as well as maintain their pursuit of net zero,” he said.The new bills scheme will see companies get a discount on wholesale gas and electricity prices for a year instead of the current system, which caps costs.Manufacturers with heavy energy usage, such as glass and steelmakers, will get a greater discount. However, most businesses will receive just 0.7p a kilowatt hour off their gas bills and 2p a Kwh off their electricity costs.The Green party MP Caroline Lucas said: “This decision does pose an existential threat to small businesses, many of whom think that in a sense they’re being left vulnerable to wholesale energy price hikes while the government washes it hands and walks away.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a high energy user the current level of help has been crucial in keeping my business going.”Potts said she opened her dry cleaners and launderette in 2019 and has had “no choice but to put my prices up but any higher just isn’t feasible”.“When you’re talking about my size of business you’re talking about keeping a roof over a family’s head, not the level of bonus being paid to high earners,” she added.The government will spend an estimated £18bn on the first six months of the scheme and has said the cost of its final 12 months will be capped at £5.5bn.On Monday the government also announced a revamp of the capacity market – which is designed to ensure there is a reliable electricity supply regardless of the weather – to incentivise investment into low-carbon technologies.\n",

      "Input text: The largest council in Queensland’s Darling Downs region has called on the state government to put a moratorium on new coal seam gas projects after local farmers raised concerns about subsidence.The Toowoomba regional council on Tuesday unanimously passed the motion that requested a temporary prohibition after discussing a submission to the state government’s proposed amendments to the Regional Planning Interests Act.Bill Cahill, the councillor who raised the motion, said the council had heard from a delegation of farmers at its October meeting who outlined the potential risks of coal seam gas extraction, including sinking soil and impacts to underground aquifers, and that councillors had voted to “represent our community”.“It’s about taking time, taking stock of where we are up to and asking the government to have another look at some of the science, frameworks and legislation,” Cahill said.Australian farmers back EU decision to extend approval of controversial herbicide glyphosateRead moreMore than 9,000 onshore natural gas wells have been developed west of the Toowoomba council area over the past two decades, and Arrow Energy – a joint venture between Shell and PetroChina – is expanding into the local government area, in some of the most productive agricultural land in the country.Another councillor, Megan O’Hara Sullivan, said the council hoped to send a message to the Queensland government to stop approving new fossil fuel projects.“Being polite and vanilla is not enough,” Sullivan said. “We can see from the droughts, the flood events and the fires that weather events are more extreme. Local government have to advocate and that’s about the only thing we can do.”The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said there could be no new oil or gas projects if the world wants to limit global heating to 1.5C.An Arrow Energy spokesperson said the company had invested nearly $90m in the Toowoomba area in the past 18 months and was committed to addressing local council and landowner’s concerns.“Our Surat Gas Project brings numerous benefits to the Toowoomba community, including increased job opportunities and economic growth,” the spokesperson said.\n",

      "Ellie Smith, the Queensland coordinator of Lock the Gate, said the council’s stance would not have any immediate impact on coal seam gas approvals but it could affect future decisions.“Local councils in other areas have advocated very strongly for their communities and it has had a big impact on decision makers,” she said.Toowoomba joins five other regional Queensland councils in opposing coal seam gas development.Arrow Energy withdrew its application to renew exploration permits within the Scenic Rim regional council area after encountering significant community opposition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Lock the GateOn Wednesday the Environmental Defenders Office and Lock the Gate held a legal seminar on the Cecil Plains – a priority agriculture area on the western fringe of the Toowoomba council area – to educate landholders about their rights if Arrow Energy requests access to their land.“As Arrow comes into the Toowoomba regional council we understand there will be a lot of land holders that will be holding out,” Smith said.“Now it’s in the hands of the Palaszczuk government whether or not they are going to listen to the local community and local council … or continue to push ahead.”The Queensland government has announced a “new gas frontier”, releasing $21m in grants for companies to expand into untapped gas reserves.The Queensland resources department said it was yet to formally receive the motion made by Toowoomba regional council.“The state’s resources sector operates within a coexistence framework which balances the interests of resource companies and landholders, manages environmental impacts and provides economic benefits to the people of Queensland,” a department spokesperson said.\n",

      "Input text: Officials in Montana sought to downplay an unprecedented trial over a state’s obligations to protect residents from the climate crisis, saying on Monday that a victory by the young plaintiffs in the case would not change approvals for fossil fuel projects.Attorneys for Montana’s Republican attorney general began laying out their defense following a week of testimony that was often highly personal and evocative in state court from more than a dozen young people who sued the state in 2020.The 16 plaintiffs, ranging in age from five to 22 years old, say they’re being harmed by wildfire smoke, excessive heat and other effects of the heating climate, driven by human activity in the industrial age.They’re asking a judge to declare unconstitutional a state law that prevents agencies from considering the effect of greenhouse gases when they issue permits for fossil fuel development.Experts say greenhouse gas emissions from coal, oil and natural gas are making the Earth hotter and the leading body on climate policy warns that this is pushing the world to the brink of irrevocable damage that only swift and drastic action can avert.Scientists deliver ‘final warning’ on climate crisis: act now or it’s too lateRead morePlaintiffs’ attorneys say Montana has never denied a permit for a fossil fuel project, but the state’s lead environmental regulator testified in court on Monday that practices involving the issuing of permits would not change if the young environmentalists win their case.“We do not have the authority to not permit something that fully complies with the law,” said the department of environmental quality (DEQ) director, Chris Dorrington. “We are not the ones that created the law. We are the ones that implement the law.”State officials also drew a distinction between the law being challenged – a provision of the Montana Environmental Protection Act that they characterized as “procedural” – and regulatory acts such as the Clean Air Act of Montana.Only regulatory acts can be used as the basis for permit rejections, and those don’t allow permits to be denied in Montana based on climate impacts, said the DEQ air, energy and mining division administrator, Sonja Nowakowski.The young plaintiffs testified over five days last week that the climate crisis is marring their lives, with smoke from worsening wildfires choking the air they breathe. Meanwhile drought is drying up rivers that sustain agriculture, fish, wildlife and recreation.Olivia Vesovich, 20, a student at the University of Montana who grew up in Missoula, said she suffers from breathing problems that make wildfire smoke nearly unbearable.As her respiratory reactions grew worse during the frequent smoke events that have shrouded Missoula, Vesovich said her mother in recent years started taking them on long trips during fires to find cleaner air.“It feels like it’s suffocating me, like if I’m outside for [just] minutes,” Vesovich said. “Climate change is wreaking so much havoc on our world right now and I know that will only be getting worse.”In prior rulings, state district judge Kathy Seeley significantly narrowed the scope of the case. Even if the plaintiffs prevail, Seeley has said she would not order officials to formulate a new approach to climate action.Instead, the judge could issue what’s called a “declaratory judgment”, saying officials violated the state constitution. That would set a new legal precedent of courts weighing in on cases typically left to other government branches.\n",

      "Input text: After months of extreme weather that tore through New Zealand’s road, power and communications networks, the government has pledged a large, rapid funding boost to adapt infrastructure for the climate crisis, including an expansion of the nationwide network of electric vehicle charging stations.The NZ$6bn announced in Thursday’s budget for a national resilience plan will initially be spent on clean-up and recovery from record-breaking floods that swamped Auckland in January and Cyclone Gabrielle, which in February devastated parts of the North Island. But finance minister Grant Robertson promised in remarks at parliament on Thursday that attention would then turn to increasing the “resilience” of New Zealand’s infrastructure to cope with increasing climate-related weather disasters.New Zealand budget 2023: Chris Hipkins focuses on young families suffering in cost of living crisisRead moreThe funding includes $300m for “significant upgrades” to roads for slip prevention, flood mitigation, and managing the risk of rising seas, said Michael Wood, the transport minister, in a statement.“It was unacceptable that basic lifeline services like telecommunications, power and transport links were knocked out for so long,” Robertson added, referring to the recent cyclone and storms.With damage from the twin disasters expected to cost billions, Robertson had warned that this year’s budget would be a no frills document, prompting questions about how the Labour government would balance the cost of weather clean-up and recovery with years of promised commitments to curbing greenhouse gas emissions.Megan Woods, the energy and resources minister, said in a statement on Thursday that the government’s investments would do both, making the transport network “more resilient to weather events, and climate friendly”.Measures to address emissions included $120m over four years to expand the country’s electric vehicle charging network, Woods said, with a focus on rural areas. A partnership with the private sector will produce up to 23 hubs, each supplying up to 20 EV chargers.A grant was announced for purchases of low emissions heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses to incentivise change to a national vehicle fleet that’s among the world’s oldest and dirtiest.Funds were also pledged for adaptation in remote communities, such as Westport in the South Island, that are most threatened by floods, storms and sea level rises.The $6bn for a national resilience plan would, during its first two years, “focus on cyclone rebuild and recovery”, Robertson told reporters on Thursday. Improving the “resilience” of infrastructure in the long-term would follow, he added.This year’s weather disasters drew fresh attention to the country’s ailing infrastructure. New Zealand’s crumbling state highways in its remote regions – including some hardest hit by Cyclone Gabrielle – are the result of decades of inefficiencies and under-investment in infrastructure, successive reports and Treasury figures have said.The new national resilience plan would “reduce the severe infrastructure deficits that have held New Zealand back”, Robertson said.The funding committed in this year’s budget amounted to “more than business as usual”, the finance minister said, and would be paid for through “making greater use of the government’s balance sheet”. Labour had already committed to $71bn for infrastructure over the next five years, he added.\n",

      "Input text: Rich nations are undermining work to protect poor and vulnerable countries from the impacts of the climate crisis, by providing loans instead of grants, siphoning off money from other aid projects or mislabelling cash, new research suggests.Only $11.5bn (£9.2bn) of climate finance from rich countries in 2020 was devoted to helping poor countries adapt to extreme weather, despite increasing incidences of climate-related disaster, according to a report from the charity Oxfam.Nafkote Dabi, Oxfam’s international climate change policy lead, said this was inadequate given the scale of the problem. “Don’t be fooled into thinking $11.5bn is anywhere near enough for low- and middle-income countries to help their people with more and bigger floods, hurricanes, firestorms, droughts and other terrible harms brought about by climate change,” she said. “People in the US spend four times that each year feeding their cats and dogs.”‘The window is closing’: Cop28 must deliver change of course on climateRead moreUnder a promise made by the developed world in 2009, developing countries should have been receiving $100bn a year in climate finance from 2020, made up of funds to help countries adapt to climate impacts and to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. But that pledge has so far gone unmet, with only $83bn provided in 2020.Estimates suggest that the $100bn figure should be exceeded this year, but Oxfam said standard estimates overstated the true amounts. That is because some of the money has been taken from existing overseas aid budgets, and some of what is counted as climate finance includes funds primarily allocated to development projects such as health and education, with only tangential benefits to the climate.Oxfam also argues that finance should be provided in the form of grants rather than loans, though some donor countries defend the use of loans.If all of these sums are stripped out, then only $21bn to $24.5bn of the $83bn remains as pure climate finance without strings attached, according to Oxfam in its Climate Finance Shadow Report 2023, published on Monday.Climate finance will come under close scrutiny this week, at UN negotiations to be held in Bonn, ahead of the Cop28 climate summit that starts on 30 November.This year’s summit – Cop stands for “conference of the parties” under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change – will be hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a major oil-producing country that plans to expand its fossil fuel production capacity.Sultan Al Jaber, president-designate of Cop28, is also head of UAE’s national oil company, Adnoc, a dual role that many campaigners have warned represents a conflict of interests.Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and twice a climate envoy for the UN, led a group of prominent women in writing to the UN at the weekend, asking for a clear “firewall” to be set up between the Cop preparations and UAE’s oil industry.“So far, UAE hasn’t shown signs of prioritising action to address the impact of climate change on vulnerable people, especially women,” they wrote. “Some are saying that the talks are heading for a car crash – instead of leading to address the emergency for people, climate and nature, we are also facing an emergency for the survival of the UN multilateral system and democracy.”At this week’s preparatory meeting, governments will discuss how to set up a fund to help poor countries with loss and damage, which means the ravages of climate breakdown that are too severe for countries to adapt to them. They will also lay out some of the groundwork for assessing how close countries are to meeting their pledges on cutting greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a process known as the “global stocktake”.Al Jaber has talked of the need for a “course correction” at Cop28 that would put the world on track to meet the Paris goals. He told the Guardian, in a rare interview, that boosting the deployment of renewable energy was key and that there were encouraging signs.But he said governments and activists needed to show unity. “We need to stop the fingerpointing. We need to stop this polarisation. We need to flip the page and start focusing on being optimistic, positive and working together in harmony.” This article was amended on 5 June 2023 to remove a reference to $88bn where $83bn was meant.\n",

      "Input text: A US plant that supplies wood pellets to the UK power generator Drax has violated air pollution limits in Mississippi, it has emerged.The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) has written to Amite BioEnergy notifying the Drax-owned company that it had violated emissions rules.The notice of violation, which has been seen by the Guardian, said that while the plant was permitted to “operate as a minor source for hazardous air pollutants”, a review of Amite’s monitoring reports had shown the factory had been a “major” source of hazardous air pollutants from January 2021 until late last year.The plant in Gloster, Mississippi, converts trees sourced from southern states into wooden pellets, which are burnt as biomass fuel in Drax’s huge power station in Selby, North Yorkshire.The sustainability of Drax’s operations has increasingly come under scrutiny from MPs and environmental campaigners.In 2021, Amite was fined $2.5m (£2m) after breaching air pollution rules. It is unclear whether the latest breach will lead to a financial penalty.A woodchip pile at a Amite BioEnergy site. Photograph: DraxThe notice of violation, issued in March, said the company was permitted to emit 24 tons (22 tonnes) a year of hazardous air pollutants on a rolling 12-month basis, but reached as much as 37 tons between January 2021 and December 2022, peaking in July 2022.The MDEQ asked Amite for an explanation and what action it had taken to correct the violation.In response, Drax argued that pellet production was a relatively young industry, adding: “Several wood pellet facilities, not only Amite BioEnergy, initially underestimated emissions in connection with the permitting of these facilities.“Amite BioEnergy has a history of acting quickly to update emissions and permits upon discovery of new emission factors and new information pertaining to other pellet production plants.”Amite argued that, according to its analysis, it was only non-compliant for a short period – between late October and early November 2021.Great Britain’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has launched an investigation, which will be carried out by the US consulting group Black & Veatch, over whether Drax’s operations are aligned with biomass sustainability rules.Last year, the UK government was accused of funding “environmental racism” in the US south by providing subsidies to Drax. The company, which has a stock market valuation of more than £2bn, received £617m in government subsidies in 2022.In the US, Matt Williams, a campaigner for Cut Carbon Not Forests and a senior advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of Drax: “It’s already been fined once. But a $2m fine is pocket change to a company that receives hundreds of millions of pounds in subsidies every year by claiming to be green. And now it’s doing it again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The UK government needs to stop handing billions of pounds in subsidies to companies like this that are poisoning people’s air, making climate change worse, and destroying forests.”John Randall, a former Conservative MP who was an environment adviser to Theresa May, said another breach by Drax was “extremely worrying”.Lord Randall added : “It’s imperative that Drax, which receives millions in bill-payer subsidies, cleans up its act immediately.”A Drax spokesperson said that in January 2022 an environmental consultant reviewed its air pollution calculations and “identified some discrepancies” before the company contacted MDEQ to “fine tune” the calculations and update the readings.The spokesperson said: “Drax took prompt corrective action in response and worked with MDEQ to resolve the issues and provide them with accurate reports and permit applications. We continue to work with leading environmental consultants to ensure that we monitor and report permit compliance in a rigorous and transparent manner.“Drax is committed to environmental compliance and remains focused on transparency and open communication with the [US] Environmental Protection Agency, MDEQ and the community.“The safety of our people and the communities in which we operate is our priority, and we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously.”The company reported annual profits of £731m in 2022, up from £398m the year before, and last month said it would hand investors £150m through a share buyback. Last week, Drax told investors it planned to expand significantly in the US.\n",

      "Input text: A rapid reduction in fossil fuels, essential to avoid devastating climate breakdown, would have minimal financial impact on the vast majority of people, new research has shown.Urgently cutting back on fossil fuel production is essential to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown and the economic and social turmoil that would ensue. However, some opponents of climate action claim it is too expensive. They argue that rapidly scaling back fossil fuel production would leave billions of pounds of “stranded assets”, leading to an economic slump that would impoverish the public through a fall in the value of savings and pension funds.Research published on Thursday finds that the loss of fossil fuel assets would have a minimal impact on the general public.“We find that the bulk of financial losses associated with rotten, polluting assets is borne by the wealthy,” said the co-author Lucas Chancel, a professor of economics at Sciences Po in Paris. “Only a small share of financial losses is borne by the working and middle class because they have no or relatively little financial wealth.”The study, published in the journal Joule, found that in high-income countries two-thirds of the financial losses would be borne by the most affluent 10%. In contrast, governments could easily compensate for the minimal impact on those on middle and lower levels of wealth.Chancel said: “These latter groups have nothing to fear from rapid action, in particular if governments decide to compensate for their losses, which can be done at relatively low cost.”The study found that in the US, two-thirds of the financial losses from lost fossil fuel assets would affect the top 10% of wealth holders, with half of that affecting the top 1%.Because the wealthiest people tend to have a “diverse portfolio of investments”, it found, any losses would still make up less than 1% of this group’s net wealth.Just 3.5% of financial losses from stranded assets would affect the poorest half of Americans and could easily be compensated for by government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

      "Input text: The climate crisis has caused the ailing Colorado River basin, a system relied upon by 40 million people in the US west, to lose more than 10tn gallons of water in the last two decades, new research has found.The volume of water lost due to rising global temperatures has been so enormous that it is equal to the entire storage capacity of Lake Mead, the US’s largest reservoir that was formed by the Hoover Dam, or enough water to fill about 15m Olympic-sized swimming pools.‘What are we willing to sacrifice?’ A journey down America’s most endangered riverRead moreThe Colorado River provides vital water supplies to people across the US west, as well as nourishes ecosystems and millions of acres of farmland, but has dwindled since 2000 due to a “megadrought” that has been significantly worsened by climate change.Without the influence of human-caused global heating, researchers for the new study found, reservoir levels wouldn’t have slumped to such low levels that the first ever federally declared water shortage was declared, requiring a desperate, temporary deal to be struck between states in May to cut water use.Benjamin Bass, a hydrological modeler at the University of California-Los Angeles and lead author of the study, said the researchers were “surprised” at how sensitive the Colorado River basin is to warming temperatures.“The fact that warming removed as much water from the basin as the size of Lake Mead itself during the recent megadrought is a wakeup call to the climate change impacts we are living today,” Bass said.The Colorado River basin covers the vast sweep of the US west, across seven states, that is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries. This area, spanning around 250,000 sq miles, is critical as a water resource for cities, cropland and wildlife but has withered under the region’s worst drought in at least 1,200 years.A new hydrological model developed for the new study shows that warming temperatures – the basin is 1.5C (2.7F) hotter on average than it was in 1880 – has led to a 10.3% reduction in water runoff. Parts of the basin that are usually snow-covered in winter, which builds up vital snowpack that then melts and nourishes the river in springtime, are losing water at twice the rate of snowless regions, suggesting the Rocky Mountain west is shifting to a more arid state rather than experiencing a mere prolonged drought, Bass said.Rising global heat is responsible, in total, for 10tn gallons (or about 40tn liters) of water to be lost from the Colorado River system since 2000, the study concluded. This is enough to fill the entire Lake Mead, which has hit record-low levels due to the drought, or 15bn Olympic swimming pools.The deal struck between California, Nevada and Arizona in May brought a temporary reprieve to the growing crisis around the Colorado River, as did the torrential bursts of rainfall and snowfall over winter that helped replenish many reservoirs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An earlier version said that 10tn gallons of water would fill about 15bn Olympic-sized swimming pools; the correct figure is about 15m such pools.\n",

      "Input text: Half of Britain and Ireland’s native plants have declined over the past 20 years, with non-native species now more numerous in the wild, a major study has found.Thousands of botanists from the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) have spent the past 20 years collecting data on changes in the British and Irish flora.The research, published in Plant Atlas 2020, has implications for native insects and other species which rely on the plants they evolved alongside.plant diversity graphsAgricultural practices and the climate crisis are the main drivers of decline in native plant species, scientists said, as they called for urgent action to tackle the loss.Changes in farming since the 1950s such as nitrogen enrichment, habitat degradation and changes in grazing pressure have led to the decline of species such as heather andharebell, the research found. Additionally, damp meadows have been drained, leading to substantial declines in plants such as devil’s-bit scabious – a plant fed on by rare butterflies.introduced plant species mapAncient arable wildflowers such as corn marigold fared worse than other species; with a 62% decline. This is because traditional grasslands have been reseeded or over-fertilised.Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: “The decline of our beautiful native plants is heartbreaking and has consequences for us all. The loss of natural habitats due to modern farming methods over the last 70 years has been an unmitigated disaster for wildflowers and all the species that depend on them including insects, bats and birds.“But it’s not too late to stop this catastrophe. The government’s new farm environment schemes must do what was originally promised and reverse the decline of nature in our agricultural landscape. Also, protection for local wildlife sites needs to be increased, and the promise made by the government at the recent UN biodiversity summit to halve nutrient pollution by 2030 must be honoured.”Climate breakdown has affected many species. For example, mountain plants such as alpine lady-fern, alpine speedwell and snow pearlwort depend on areas where the snow lies late in the spring and summer.Of the 3,445 different plant species recorded during fieldwork, 1,692 are native to Britain while 1,753 non-natives were found that have been deliberately or accidentally introduced into the wild by humans. Many of the non-native species originate from gardens and then spread to establish self-sustaining populations. The planting of non-native spruce is degrading peatland habitats, researchers found, and sitka spruce, which regenerates into peatland and moorland, has shown the most significant increase in range of any species recorded.sitka spruce graphicDr Kevin Walker, BSBI head of science and Plant Atlas 2020 co-author, said: “There’s a lot we can do to reverse these declines, but the most important are to increase the protection plants receive, extend the habitat available to them, and to place their needs at the very heart of nature conservation. We also need to ensure that our land, water and soil are managed more sustainably so that plants, and the species which rely upon them for food and shelter, can thrive.”\n",

      "Input text: Twelve people have died from heat-related causes in South Korea as it swelters through a heatwave, while in Japan it emerged a 13-year-old girl had died from heatstroke on her way back from a school club.South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported that at least five of those who died over the weekend were farmers, and at least seven were over 70, including some in their 90s. Most of the country has been under a heatwave warning – issued when temperatures pass 35C – since Tuesday. Over the previous week, three people are believed to have died from heat-related causes.Phoenix’s record streak of temperatures above 110F ends after 31 daysRead moreIn Japan, a 13-year-old girl was found unconscious on a pavement on Friday. She had been cycling home after attending a school club and was taken to hospital where she later died from what authorities believe was heatstroke, the Mainichi reports.The school had suspended the club gatherings an hour early due to concerns about the heat and said that students had taken breaks “every 20-25 minutes to rehydrate”, the Mainichi reported.Elsewhere, an elderly couple were found dead in their home in Tokyo by a healthcare worker, bringing the death toll since Friday to three. Police believe they died of heatstroke as temperatures in the city reached 35.7C and their air conditioning was not on.The deaths in Japan comes weeks after the government set a target to halve the number of heat-related deaths by 2030.People cool off in a public park alongside the Han River in Seoul, South Korea, 31 July 2023, as a sweltering heat wave grips the country. Photograph: YONHAP/EPAStatistics from the health ministry reported by the Japan Times show that the number of heatstroke-related deaths increased from an average of 201 people a year between 1995 and 1999, to an average of 1295 from 2018 to 2022. Between 80 and 90% of those who die are over 65, according to data cited by the Japan Times.Research shows that older people are more vulnerable to heatwaves. Japan has the second-highest proportion of people 65 and over worldwide, which has important implications for climate change adaptation.By 2025, one in five people in South Korea are expected to be older than 65, making it home to a “super ageing population”, according to research published in the Lancet. By 2050, 44% of South Koreans may be over 65.A man cools off in a public water playground at a park in eastern Tokyo on 16 July as temperatures reached 35C. Photograph: Richard A Brooks/AFP/Getty ImagesJapan has revised its climate change adaptation law to introduce a “special heatstroke alert”, based on a measurement called the “wet bulb globe temperature” index.When heat and humidity combine, sweat doesn’t evaporate, which limits the body’s ability to cool itself. The wet bulb temperature (WBT) index uses both heat and humidity to give an indication of how dangerous a heatwave is.A dangerous wet bulb temperature is usually considered to be 35C, which is an air temperature of 40C and relative humidity of 75%, but the threshold may be lower.The special alerts are expected to be introduced in 2024, the Japan Times reported.\n",

      "Input text: Sport England, which invests more than £300m of public money every year, intends to ask sports to do far more to fight the climate crisis as a condition of receiving funding, the Guardian can reveal.The radical move was signalled by the funding body’s chair, Chris Boardman, who said that while his organisation planned to work closely with sports to help them decarbonise and better protect the environment “the status quo is no longer an option”.Stokes backed to inspire Team GB by going for gold at 2028 LA OlympicsRead more“Without veering into hyperbole, it’s so that we don’t all die,” Boardman told the Guardian. “It’s just a massive topic for everybody. It’s the biggest topic that we will face.”Sport England provides between £10m and £25m to a number of major sporting bodies over a five-year period – including British Cycling, England Netball, the Rugby Football Union, the England and Wales Cricket Board, Swim England and England Athletics – as well as smaller sums to hundreds of other groups to fund grassroots sport and get more people active.But Boardman, an Olympic and world champion cyclist before moving into TV commentary and sports governance, acknowledged that sport as a whole needed to step up when it came to the climate crisis.“Sport England is an organisation that has huge influence,” he said. “We deal with hundreds of partners, who deal with millions of people. So we have a responsibility to do something, and we are going to. I feel both good about it and quite scared at the same time, because it is so big.”Chris Boardman, an Olympic gold medallist in 1992 and now chair of Sport England. Photograph: Lucy Ray/PAMeetings with sports will begin next month, with the ambition that in future Sport England’s code of conduct – which all organisations sign before they get funding – will also include a requirement for governing bodies to outline plans to fight the climate emergency.“Fundamentally we have got to move from a position of ‘inform and encourage’ to one of ‘enable and require’,” he said. “That’s essentially what it is: to shift from talking about it, and using language that gives people a way out, to say: ‘No, we have to do this.’”Boardman stressed that some sports were already stepping up, pointing to the work being done to make swimming pools more energy efficient. He also highlighted small steps, such as the LTA replacing all its lightbulbs with LED lights and its gas stoves going electric, as illustrations of what could be done.“In a sense it’s like marginal gains in sport, ironically,” said Boardman. “Rather than set a large target years in the future, we are asking what small things we can do now and what will that add up to? And I suspect it will be an awful lot.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So we’ll take tangible steps and set targets both for ourselves and with partners so that we can at least track progress, which is what I did as an athlete.”Boardman will set out Sport England’s new position at the Blue Earth Summit in Bristol . on Thursday, where he is expected to say that if global temperatures increase by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels we risk seeing irreversible impacts, with deprived communities the most affected.He will also warn that the effects on sport and physical activity will also be profound. And that 23 out of the 92 English league football grounds – a quarter in total – can expect temporary or permanent flooding by 2050.“Sport emotionally connects with people,” added Boardman. “And we have seen the impact that people like Marcus Rashford have. So there’s an influencing aspect here, but it’s also recognising that everybody in the country is going to have to do this. It’s almost inevitable.”\n",

      "Input text: Indigenous knowledge may have helped solve the scientific mystery of how polka-dot “fairy circles” occur in Australian deserts.The bare circular patches were first recorded by scientists in Africa in the 1970s, sparking a global debate about the phenomenon.Ethnoecologist Fiona Walsh said scientists had concluded they came about from plants competing for water and nutrients.But traditional owners have a different hypothesis for the circles that are between two and 12 metres in diameter.\n",

      "Martu elder Gladys Bidu said the patches are called linyji and termites live in the ground under them.“I learnt this from my old people and have seen it myself many times,” she said.“We gathered and ate the Warturnuma [flying termites] that flew from linyji.”Bidu said her ancestors also used the rock hard circles to break open and crush seeds for use in food, such as damper.Victorian agencies accused of failing to consult traditional owners over feeding of stranded brumbies in national parkRead more“Aboriginal people told us that these regular circular patterns of bare pavements are occupied by spinifex termites,” Walsh said on Tuesday.“We saw similarities between the patterns in Aboriginal art and aerial views of the pavements and found paintings that have deep and complex stories about the activities of termites and termite ancestors.”Researchers surveyed and excavated trenches on land containing multiple fairy circles in Nyiyaparli country, east of Newman in Western Australia’s Pilbara region.They also looked at patches at Newhaven, an Australian Wildlife Conservancy property in Warlpiri country in the Northern Territory.“The pavement surface is concrete hard,” Walsh said.“After we dug and then dusted to clean the trenches, 100% of them had termite chambers seen horizontally and vertically in the matrix.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "Input text: The Labour party has pledged to introduce a Scottish-style right to roam law in England if it wins the next general election, with access to green space enshrined in law.The shadow environment minister, Alex Sobel, made the announcement during a debate secured by the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, who has been campaigning for wider access to the countryside.Only 8% of England has a right to roam, which covers coastal paths, mountains and moorland. Some private landowners, such as national trusts and some farmers, open their land and pathways for people to walk in and that is not included in the 8% figure.In Scotland, there is a right to walk through the countryside, leaving no trace, with some exceptions such as not trampling over land that is growing crops. Under a Labour government, people in England would be granted the same rights.The right to roam campaign has been gaining momentum, with thousands of people having taken part in mass trespasses last summer to demand more access to the countryside.Sobel said: “Labour’s approach, like in Scotland, will be that Labour’s right to roam will offer access to high-quality green and blue space in the rest of Britain. We will replace the default of exclusion with a default of access.“Research shows that people with a stronger connection to nature were more likely to behave positively towards the environment. It’s quite simple: the more people engage with nature, the more likely they are to protect it.”He pointed out that access to nature was unfairly distributed in England, with people from minority ethnic groups and those in less affluent areas less likely to have accessible green space nearby.“Labour will create a future where nature thrives, people have a deeper connection to the environment, and people have equal access to the benefits of green spaces,” the MP for Leeds North West added.Jim McMahon, the shadow environment secretary, previously said that in government he would extend the right to roam but did not say a Scottish-style system would be in place.He said in January: “There are still huge parts of England and Wales that are off-limits when it comes to the right to access, whether that’s woodlands, cliffs or rivers, where the rights that we are afforded in open countryside aren’t then mirrored in those places. That needs to change.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

People can’t do that right now as they are confronted by fences and barbed wires and ‘trespassers will be prosecuted’ notices.”The Right to Roam campaign said: “Labour’s commitment to introduce, if elected, a new right to roam act – which would follow Scotland in replacing a ‘default of exclusion with a default of access’ – is extremely welcome.“Scotland has had a right of responsible access to the majority of land for the last 20 years, with sensible exemptions and restrictions. It’s been very successful and it’s high time that the public in England were given the same opportunities to reconnect to nature and to care for it.”\n",

      "Input text: A baby beaver has been photographed in London for the first time in 400 years, 18 months after an initiative began to reintroduce the species to the capital.Enfield council began London’s beaver reintroduction programme last year as part of a wider rewilding and natural flood-management project.The semi-aquatic rodents were hunted to extinction in the 16th century during the Elizabethan era as they were predominantly killed for their fur and meat.Mass death of Amazonian dolphins prompts fears for vulnerable speciesRead moreCapel Manor college, a special environmental college, with advice from the Beaver Trust, will give the beaver a comprehensive health check with an experienced exotic-animal vet. The animal’s sex has yet to be established.Rick Jewell, Enfield council’s cabinet member for the environment, told the Daily Telegraph: “The beavers’ hard work creating a natural wetland ecosystem will contribute to excellent flood defences, protecting the local area and hundreds of homes from flooding downstream to the south-east of the borough, while encouraging biodiversity.”Meg Wilson, Capel Manor college’s animal collections manager, said: “We are thrilled [about] this new arrival.“We have seen the developments the beavers are [involved in] and the improvements they have made to the wetland area. We are now focusing our efforts on collecting data, which we hope will provide further evidence about the positive effects the beavers are having on the environment.”The project could see the mammals inhabit a 10-acre area of parkland in Ealing, west London. People in London will be able to go on “beaver safaris” to see the creatures as part of the rewilding project.Beavers were reintroduced within fenced enclosures in England and Wales several years ago as part of a rewilding campaign.In August it was reported that parts of a North Yorkshire estate are growing into a young woodland that is already becoming a new home for insects, rodents and birds of prey. The Broughton Sanctuary near Skipton is about halfway through its rewilding project through which it aims to restore more than 400 hectares (1,000 acres) of bare hillside.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In July, a family of four was released on the National Trust’s Wallington estate in Northumberland, partly to help the landscape deal with climate breakdown.\n",

      "Input text: Water companies will be seeking big bill rises as they face huge infrastructure investment demands, the chief executive of the water regulator, Ofwat, has said.David Black denied that the water industry was badly regulated and defended Ofwat’s role in an industry saddled with debt and facing public anger over poor performance, high dividends, executive pay and sewage pollution.Black said the £60bn of debt taken on by privatised water firms, including struggling Thames Water, which has the highest gearing in the industry, was “their issue to sort out”.As taxpayers face having to bail out Thames Water if it fails to secure billions from its shareholders to secure its future, Black said the regulator had not had the right powers to tackle huge dividend payments by water firms, and high levels of debt.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, Black added that he “completely disagreed” that water was a poorly regulated industry.He blamed the lack of powers given to the regulator at privatisation more than 30 years ago for the behaviour of some companies, with soaring levels of executive pay, £72bn paid out in dividends, poor performance, high levels of leaks, and the worst levels of pollution for years.Levels of debt in the industry range from Thames Water at £14bn, more than 80% of debt to capital value, or gearing, to companies whose gearing is at more than 60%.High interest rates and inflation are hugely increasing costs on the debt companies owe, more than half of which on average is inflation-linked.Simultaneously water companies face having to fund the biggest infrastructure investment ever to reduce raw sewage dumping, upgrade water treatment plants, build reservoirs and fix leaky pipes. Black told the House of Lords industry and regulators committee most water companies would be asking for significant rises in water bills. “We are very concerned about the impact on bills,” he said.Black told peers the regulator should have stepped in in 2006 to stop companies as they began taking on huge levels of debt but did not have the powers to do so at the time.“We now have the powers and we have used those,” said Black, referring to new powers in 2021 under which the regulator says it will stop water companies paying dividends if doing so would harm their financial resilience and stop companies paying bonuses to executives.Black said Thames Water – which is seeking billions of pounds from shareholders to secure its future – was a long way off needing special administration – the insolvency process for water companies, which secures the services for the public.“The question is for Thames to come forward with proposals to inject more equity into this business. Thames is talking to their investors.” But he admitted investors in Thames Water were reluctant to provide the money. He said the backstop option was special administration but “we are still a long way off that”.“Thames are looking for new finance to come to business in the early part of next year,” said Black.\n",

      "Input text: Particles in bushfire smoke can activate molecules that destroy the ozone layer, according to new research that suggests future ozone recovery may be delayed by increasingly intense and frequent fires.A study published in the journal Nature has found that smoke from the 2019-20 Australian bushfires temporarily depleted the ozone layer by 3% to 5% in 2020.Smoke from the fires, which circulated around the globe, was ejected into the stratosphere, the second layer in Earth’s atmosphere, by a pyrocumulonimbus cloud.Smoke from Black Summer bushfires depleted ozone layer, study findsRead moreIn the ozone layer – part of the stratosphere – molecules of ozone gas absorb high-energy ultraviolet rays from the sun. This lessens the amount of radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface.\n",

      "The lead researcher, Prof Susan Solomon, an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, said the ozone destruction by smoke particles was similar to the process of the Antarctic ozone hole forming each spring, “but at much warmer temperatures”.Smoke aerosols, the researchers found, can activate chlorine to form compounds that then destroy ozone molecules.Solomon said chlorine in the stratosphere had been decreasing since the 1987 Montreal protocol phased out the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. “There’s a tremendous science policy success story there,” she said. “The slow recovery of the ozone layer is on the order of 1% per decade in the mid-latitudes.”But she warned that more frequent fires could delay ozone recovery. “All of a sudden, in one year [2020], we had a 3% to 5% loss. It’ll recover if that’s the only year that it happens, but not if it keeps happening.“The question in my mind is: is the man-made chlorine going to get … diluted and destroyed out of the atmosphere faster than global climate change is going to increase the frequency and intensity of this kind of fire? I think it’s going to be a race.”Dr Martin Jucker, a lecturer at the University of New South Wales who was not involved in the research, agreed that the ozone hole might recover more slowly than expected as the result of more bushfires in future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the absence of any major changes, we expect that stratospheric chlorine concentrations will gradually decrease this century and that the ozone hole will get smaller year by year.“Of concern is that while the ozone hole usually forms over Antarctica because of the cold temperatures there, wildfire aerosols appear to be capable of promoting ozone losses at the relatively warmer temperatures present at mid-latitudes which are heavily populated.”Solomon and her colleagues identified that the ozone-destruction process was triggered by hydrochloric acid in the stratosphere dissolving in the smoke aerosols.Hydrochloric acid dissolved about a thousand times more readily in the smoke aerosols than in the “the normal sulphuric acid and water stratospheric particles”, Solomon said.“From a scientific point of view, it’s very exciting to see this brand new effect,” she said. “From a planetary point of view … it would be just tragic to have mankind screw up solving the ozone hole by deciding that we’re going to [allow] a lot more of these fires if we don’t mitigate climate change.”Solomon added that it was important to determine whether the smoke from fires in Australia – where native forests are dominated by eucalypts – differed in composition from fires in other areas. “I don’t really see a chemical reason why that would be so, but it needs to be looked at.”\n",

      "Input text: Keir Starmer is likely to battle the Labour left over protest laws, green issues and a wealth tax as the party kickstarts its manifesto development.Momentum, the grassroots campaign group, hopes to make a “loud” case for left-leaning policies in the lead-up to the next general election, and will collaborate with the Socialist Campaign Group (SCG).The first intervention is understood to be imminent, with rent controls, the abolition of tuition fees and a wealth tax said to be high on the group’s agenda.However, Momentum no longer has control of any of the policy commissions or a majority of delegates on the national policy forum (NPF), Labour’s decision-making body, so is unlikely to be able to push through its proposals.A Momentum source told the Guardian: “Keir knows that leftwing policies are what’s needed. That’s why policies like rail nationalisation and a windfall tax have resonated, while no one remembers the British recovery bond yawn-athon. The lesson from the 2017 election campaign is that people want bold, clear policies: like abolishing tuition fees or nationalising our failed energy system.”On Monday, the NPF published a draft consultation paper covering six important policy areas including the environment, the future of work, crime, public services and international development.Members and campaigners have until 17 March to submit submissions or contribute to online events, airing their views before the NPF redrafts those policy papers on the basis of those submissions.Momentum and the SCG hope to ensure proposals that were popular under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership – including nationalisation, wealth taxes and the abolition of tuition fees – will make it on to the manifesto. Insiders are also understood to be hopeful that groups including Labour for a Green New Deal, which has announced a new campaign for public ownership of energy, will also launch their own interventions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starmer can do exactly the sameRead moreIn one of the few policy announcements already made, Starmer has promised a publicly owned energy company run on clean UK power – called Great British Energy – in the first year of a Labour government.The new leftwing coalition will bring a fresh headache to Starmer, who had promised Labour members over the weekend that the party had changed since the disastrous 2019 election defeat under Corbyn, telling a London conference: “Never again will Labour be a party of protest not public service. Never again will Labour fail to grasp that economic stability is the foundation of all our ambitions.“Never again will Labour allow hate to spread unchallenged. We have changed our party and we’re ready to change Britain.”Starmer faced pressure at the last Labour party conference as delegates passed union-backed motions urging public ownership of Royal Mail and inflation-proof pay rises. Labour subsequently vowed to renationalise the railways. The party leader has since confirmed his plans to shift Labour back towards the centre to lure undecided swing voters.The NPF will meet from 21-23 July to decide what will be put to Labour conference to form the final party programme, from which the manifesto will be drawn.It marks the first time since the 2015 general election that the NPF has been able to convene and officially start its manifesto work. Last summer, the party drew up plans to govern in case of a snap election while Boris Johnson was struggling to thwart a mutiny, party insiders told the Guardian.A leftwing source told the Guardian: “A Labour government will be remembered by the change it makes. Being real, everyone thinks Keir will be the next PM – the question is whether he will end up hated like Blair, or feted like [Clement] Attlee. The path will be set by the manifesto.”\n",

      "Input text: South-eastern Australia faces possible gas supply gaps for at least the next four years during bouts of extreme weather, potentially requiring exports to be diverted south, according to the gas outlook from the Australian Energy Market Operator.Aemo’s gas statement of opportunities report found that gas output in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania would meet demand until 2027. But customers could face shortfalls, particularly if cold weather coincided with low levels of renewable energy generation.“The risk of gas shortfalls each year from winter 2023 to 2026 in all southern jurisdictions remains under extreme weather conditions and periods of high gas-powered electricity generation, with those risks further exacerbated if gas storage levels are insufficient,” said Aemo’s chief executive, Daniel Westerman.Most Australian states face sharp power bill rises, despite government’s interventionRead more“While production capacity commitments have increased for 2023 compared to the 2022 GSOO and several key infrastructure projects are on track for delivery, there is forecast to be a 16% reduction in production capacity this winter compared to 2022 in Victoria, which increases supply pressure in the southern regions,” he said.Although Australia is one of the world’s largest producers of gas, most of the supply in the eastern states is earmarked for export. The main southern fields in Bass Strait are in decline, and may result in Victoria becoming a net-importer by the winter of 2027, according to Aemo’s projections.\n",

      "A prolonged and extensive cold snap last winter sent demand soaring and triggered a suspension of the national electricity market. Although gas is generally declining as a fuel for power generation, its high cost relative to historical levels and limited availability can trigger electricity price spikes as happened last year.The impact of the suspension contributed to rises in the proposed default market offers for the coming year of up to a third, regulators reported on Wednesday.Gas demand is forecast to peak more often during winter than summer when there is less solar power and “wind droughts” can set in. Victoria may be the most vulnerable among the states to shortages due to its relatively high dependence on gas space heating.View image in fullscreen Photograph: 2023 Gas Statement of OpportunitiesAemo forecast total available supply from the state’s Gippsland region would drop 13% from 2022’s output of 326PJ of gas to 284PJ this year, and more than halve to 130PJ in 2027. Port Campbell’s output would drop a third this year to 32PJ before more than doubling to 73PJ by 2024 as four new committed wells begin production.“Unless new Victorian supply is developed, Victoria is forecast to become a net importer of gas from winter 2027, as Victorian annual consumption exceeds Victorian production,” Aemo said.“Victorian supply adequacy is projected to tighten in the later years of the outlook period and an annual supply and peak day shortfall is forecast in 2027.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But investments “are needed in the near term to ensure operational solutions from 2027”, Aemo said.Across all states except Western Australia, Aemo forecasts residential and small commercial gas consumption “to gradually decline in the short term, with more significant fuel-switching in the medium to longer term as the economy transitions to meet net zero emissions goals”.“Overall, electrification is forecast to reduce natural gas consumption from residential and small commercial consumers by 158PJ, down to 75PJ by 2042,” it said.“If the rate of electrification is slower than forecast, the risk of supply gaps increases, further highlighting the uncertainty in the investment needed in gas supply.”Aemo said the assessments assume gas from Queensland’s LNG exporters is made available to the domestic market when required to avert domestic shortfalls.\n",

      "Paul Foster, an assistant chief fire officer, said the fire was well developed by the time firefighters arrived.The large plume of smoke emitted from the fire heading towards the northwest was of greatest concern, Foster said.“We want to reduce that smoke because all smoke is toxic,” Foster said, adding the burning plastic makes the smoke “a lot blacker.”Fire Rescue Victoria issued a watch and act notice to the community as the smoke plume descends.People within 2km of the Keysborough factory were warned to stay indoors.\n",

      "Input text: The UK’s fruit trees are under threat as a result of the climate crisis because plant diseases that thrive in warm weather are becoming more common.Each year, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) compiles a list of the most common plant diseases identified by its almost half a million members. Gardeners take pictures or samples of afflicted trees, crops or flowers and send them in to the plant pathologists, who can identify the disease.This year, seven of 2022’s 10 most prevalent garden diseases relate to fruit, which the RHS says is the highest it has seen. Apple and pear canker also entered the top 10 for the first time in recent years.Traditional British garden under threat from extreme heat, says RHSRead moreDr Liz Beal, a plant pathologist at the RHS, said: “This is a direct result of last year’s extreme summer heat, which caused many plants to become stressed and therefore more susceptible to problems when rain, coupled with continuing mild temperatures in the autumn, provided the perfect breeding ground for diseases to spread. Spores of most fungi need warm, wet weather to spread and infect plants.”While many of these diseases simply cause fruit to rot or give an unsightly appearance, others can be deadly. Particularly worrying is a rise in silverleaf, which can destroy blossoming cherry trees.She explained: “With warm weather predicted again this year, gardeners can act now to minimise the risks by pruning apples and pear that are still dormant and avoiding pruning Prunus – flowering cherry – until the summer. This is as Prunus is susceptible to silver leaf and the fungi is less active during the summer months.”Horticulturalists are keeping a keen eye out for new diseases and invasive species, as warming weather combined with the international plant trade means that it is becoming more likely the UK will experience new outbreaks.Blueberries fruiting in England. The RHS warns the popularity of growing the ‘superfood’ is increasing risks of less disease-resilient plants being imported into the UK. Photograph: Dean Fosdick/APDr Beal said that she is concerned about blueberry rust becoming more prevalent, as people grow the “superfood” at home.She said: “With gardeners keen to dabble with ever more exotic fruit and vegetables it is likely that we could see more blueberry growers, well regarded as a super food and boasting spring flowers and autumn colour, succumbing to a new rust already prevalent in many parts of the world. People should take care to purchase blueberry plants from reputable suppliers and monitor plants for signs of the rust – yellow – orange pustules on underside of leaves.”As well as climate impacts, establishing orchards has become an increasingly popular gardening pastime, as they have biodiversity benefits and produce delicious fruit.Dr Beal explained: “Another factor in the prevalence of these diseases is the growing popularity of fruit tree planting, particularly heritage varieties that may be less resistant to the likes of apple and pear scab, apple canker and apple powdery mildew. This doesn’t mean that people shouldn’t grow them but that they should take additional plant health precautions such as ensuring the tree is planted in the right place, for example in well-drained soil, prune correctly in the winter months to remove issues early and clear fallen fruit that shows evidence of rot to minimise the chances of spores harbouring at the foot of the tree.”The top plant diseases of 20221 Honey fungusskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

      "Input text: More than 50 billboards and bus stop adverts drawing attention to the Liverpool FC sponsor Standard Chartered’s links to the fossil fuel industry have appeared across the city, as a number of activist groups targeted the bank ahead of its annual general meeting on Wednesday.One poster design installed outside Anfield, featuring the Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp and player Mohamed Salah, reads: “Give Standard Chartered the red card.”Meanwhile another campaign group put up a fake Standard Chartered website – described as “extremely convincing” by those who saw it – which “announced” that the bank would “end all support for coal in 2021 and all fossil fuel infrastructure by 2023”. The hoax had been designed by Fridays For Future and the Yes Men. At a morning press conference the real group behind the claim revealed themselves.The campaign group Market Forces, which focuses on finance for fossil fuels, also said it would be using the shares it owns in the bank to lodge a shareholder resolution for the 2022 AGM if the bank’s policies on climate change did not improve. “We expect to attract significant support,” said their spokesperson, Adam McGibbon.The Liverpool campaign was coordinated by the activist group Brandalism. Tona Merriman, a campaigner with the group, said: “Subvertising is about using creative arts practices to directly speak back to the brands that use advertising to hide their corporate practices. Whether that’s big polluters like Shell, BP or their financiers like HSBC or Standard Chartered.”Standard Chartered has been Liverpool’s main sponsor since 2010, making it one of the longest-running sponsorship agreements in the club’s history. Activists say the partnership is inappropriate because the UK-based bank has loaned billions to fund destructive fossil fuel projects.“Liverpool have a fanbase that are proud of their progressive, working-class history and I think a lot of fans will disagree with the environmental crimes their main sponsor is committing,” said Merriman.One of the poster designs features the Standard Chartered logo, with the tagline: “Supporting deforestation, flash floods and Liverpool FC.”A Brandalism poster at a bus stop in Liverpool. Photograph: BrandalismLiverpool FC have made a public commitment to sustainability and in January launched The Red Way, an initiative that states “a sustainable future is our greatest goal”.Bill McKibben, a prominent climate campaigner, tweeted: “Very very glad youth are going after the banks like @Stanchart that drive the climate crisis. Get ready for much more of this- if your business plan undermines the earth, people will seek creative and nonviolent ways to undermine you.”A spokesperson for Standard Chartered said: “We’re supporting clients in their own transition to net zero, including through providing the capital and expertise they need to do so. Our climate risk management framework includes transition risk metrics and risk appetite which are being incorporated into our credit decisions.”The bank added that it had a non-negotiable requirement for clients to reduce their coal revenue threshold to 5% by 2030, and said it was developing transition frameworks for high-carbon sectors, as well as developing an advisory resolution for the 2022 annual meeting to support dialogue on their net zero plans.\n",

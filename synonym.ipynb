      "Input text: A water company has blamed more people working from home post-pandemic for a new hosepipe ban.South East Water, which supplies more than 2m homes and businesses, will impose the first hosepipe ban of the summer on Monday, affecting households across Kent and Sussex.The company’s chief executive, David Hinton, said that people working from home was a “key factor” behind the ban, as it has “increased drinking water demand”.In a letter to customers, he wrote: “Over the past three years the way in which drinking water is being used across the south-east has changed considerably.“The rise of working from home has increased drinking water demand in commuter towns by around 20% over a very short period, testing our existing infrastructure.”Hinton also blamed low rainfall since April as well as a recent spell of hot weather which he said led to a spike in demand for drinking water.“Our reservoir and aquifer stocks of raw water, essential to our water supply but not ready to be used, are in a good position. However, demand for treated mains water, which takes time to process and deliver, was greater than we could meet,” he said.One South East Water customer accused Mr Hinton of “victim-blaming” and described his letter as “a deflection from the real issue”.Jutta Wrobel, 61, an artist in the village of Wadhurst, East Sussex, said: “It’s not a suitable response … This is a deflection from the real issue which is how to stop South East Water paying away all our money in dividends rather than reinvesting in our water infrastructure, which is a public utility and a human right.”Wrobel started an online petition demanding a change of ownership of South East Water after she was left without mains water for five days earlier this month.She added: “The barrage of victim-blaming by South East Water is what I think has riled people up.“I’m interested in what the regulator is doing about it and whether there will be meaningful sanctions imposed on South East Water.”Greg Clark, the Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells, told the Times: “Their only job is to deliver drinking water. But in my constituency, they have run out of water twice in six months – once just before Christmas when we had a cold snap, and now after a small and unexceptional heatwave.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Following a period of consultation, we will be able to take action against customers who contravene the hosepipe restrictions from Monday 26 June.“The restrictions have been introduced to ensure that we can deliver drinking water to all our customers consistently.“Since the TUB was introduced, we have seen customer demand reduce, bringing down the high demand for tap water. We want to thank our customers for being mindful of their water use and remind them to continue to use water wisely over the coming weekend.”\n",

      "Input text: The mighty aurochs have gone, as have the tarpan horses and the wild boars, but modern-day substitutes have been drafted in to recreate a large open “savannah” on heathland in Dorset.Instead of aurochs, considered the wild ancestor of domestic cattle, 200 red Devon cattle are to be found roaming the Purbeck Heaths, while Exmoor ponies are stand-ins for the tarpan horses and curly coated Mangalitsa pigs are doing the sort of rooting around that boars used to excel at here.The idea of the project is to create more of the sort of habitat where precious species such as the sand lizard, southern damselfly and heath tiger beetle can thrive.Two Exmoor ponies at Purbeck Heaths. Photograph: National Trust ImagesIt comes three years after the UK’s first “super national nature reserve” was created in Dorset, knitting together 3,400 hectares (8,400 acres) of priority habitat. Within the super reserve, 1,370 hectares of open “savannah” for free-ranging, grazing animals as it would have been thousands of years ago is being developed with the cattle, ponies and pigs roaming freely to graze alongside deer to help shape a more diverse landscape with richer habitats.David Brown, the National Trust’s lead ecologist for Purbeck, said: “Over large swathes of open grassland and heath, these domestic grazers are now mimicking their wild ancestors, who would have shaped habitats in the past.“We can’t bring back aurochs but we can use our 200 red Devon cattle to graze and behave in equivalent ways. Similarly, Exmoor ponies mimic the actions of extinct tarpan horses, and the quirky, curly coated Mangalitsa pigs are rooting around like wild boars.Mangalitsa pig. Photograph: Terry Bagley/National Trust Images“We’re also discovering that by letting them get on with their own thing as much as possible, our grazing animals explore new habitats and discover different types of vegetation to eat – all of which help create a more dynamic and complex ecosystem.”Large herbivores can play a crucial role in helping plants and less mobile insect species move around the landscape, carrying seeds and larvae on their fur and hooves, or in their dung.By giving cattle, ponies and pigs this landscape to wander around, they are helping rare and threatened species such as Purbeck mason wasps, and heath bee-flies disperse and build stronger populations.Red Devon cattle. Photograph: National Trust ImagesBrown said: “Grazing in their own individual ways, these animals are slowly forming diverse, wildlife friendly habitats. Cattle are untidy eaters, leaving messy tussocks perfect for insects; pigs turn over the soil and help sand lizards burrow; and ponies nibble tightly down to the ground creating grassland lawns full of specialist flowers such as stork’s-bill and waxcap fungi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It’s the perfect mix of habitats in which biodiversity can thrive, and a great landscape for people to also roam freely.”Heath tiger beetle at the super reserve. Photograph: Terry Bagley/National Trust ImagesThere have been some unexpected consequences. Peter Robertson, the RSPB senior site manager, said: “What has come as a surprise is how they have created new ponds by wallowing in water-logged areas and have opened up areas of salt marsh by foraging for shellfish.”The Purbeck Heaths super reserve, which is to be the base for BBC Two’s Springwatch from Monday, is a mosaic of lowland wet and dry heath, valley mires, acid grassland and woodland, along with coastal sand dunes, lakes and salt marsh.Already one of the most biodiverse places in the UK, it is home to thousands of species of wildlife, including all six native reptiles – the adder, grass snake, slow worm, sand lizard, smooth snake and viviparous lizard.\n",

      "Input text: Large numbers of fungi have been found living in the twilight zone of the ocean, and could unlock the door to new drugs that may match the power of penicillin.The largest ever study of ocean DNA, published by the journal Frontiers in Science, has revealed intriguing secrets about the abundance of fungi in the part of the ocean that is just beyond the reach of sunlight. At between 200 metres and 1,000 metres below the surface, the twilight zone is home to a variety of organisms and animals, including specially adapted fish such as lantern sharks and kitefin sharks, which have huge eyes and glowing, bioluminescent skin.“Penicillin is an antibiotic that originally came from a fungus called Penicillium so we might find something like that from these ocean fungi,” said Fabio Favoretto, a postdoctoral scholar at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. The twilight zone is characterised by high pressure, a lack of light and cold temperatures, which presents an extreme environment “where fungi might exhibit unique adaptations”, he added. “That could potentially lead to the discovery of new species with unique biochemical properties.”Deep-sea mining: why is interest growing and what are the risks?Read moreThe new ocean DNA catalogue, launched on Tuesday, contains more than 317m marine organism gene groups compiled from samples collected on voyages including the four-year Tara Oceans expedition which started in 2009, and the 2010 Malaspina Circumnavigation expedition.Advances in technology meant existing samples could provide much more data than before, while the process of cataloguing helped open new doors into the understudied ocean, said the marine biologist and the paper’s lead author, Elisa Laiolo.The marine biotechnology sector, which relies on ocean organisms and their genes, is worth an estimated $6bn, a figure expected to almost double by 2032.Laiolo was surprised to see so many fungi living in the ocean’s twilight zone. “There have been some indications of it [fungi abundance at this level] before, so this is another piece of the puzzle.”Another critical discovery made during the cataloguing process, said Carlos Duarte, a marine science professor and senior author of the study, was the role viruses played in boosting gene diversity. “The viruses insert themselves and move genes from one organism to another. That means viruses create genomic biodiversity and that accelerates their evolution.”One result of that acceleration, he said, were genes that had evolved to enable organisms to chew through plastic. “They can degrade synthetic polymers, derived from hydrocarbons, which are very recent as a pollutant in the ocean, showing that evolution happened in a few decades.”The catalogue also highlighted gaps in our understanding of the ocean floor, said Laiolo. “It is easier to sample the water than the ocean floor and what we underline in the paper is the need to increase studies targeting the seabed in the future.”A Rosette sampler aboard the Hespérides, one of the two ships used for the Malaspina expedition in 2010. Data collected then has been included in the new catalogue. Photograph: Joan Costa/CSICDevelopments in supercomputing and sequencing technologies, she said, means more information can be gleaned from existing samples, at much lower costs.Despite the catalogue’s benefits, Duarte said there were problems with marine gene ownership and sharing of the benefits, particularly with countries in the global south that lacked the same access to gene-sequencing and analytical supercomputing. “Currently, 10 nations own 90% of marine gene patents, the benefits are not being shared,” he said.Changes to ownership rules are being made, however. “Since October last year a new treaty came into force that says those that discover a marine gene, own it.” said Duarte. “But they have to share the benefits. The problem is, it’s not clear how that benefit sharing is going to work.”The catalogue’s release was welcomed by marine scientists. Favoretto described it as a “remarkable resource for biodiversity assessment and conservation efforts” that would enable researchers to monitor changes in species distribution, particularly in relation to the impact of the climate crisis and human activities.\n",

      "Input text: Crisis talks are continuing about the future of Thames Water. But what are the options for the country’s largest water and sewerage company?Special administrationThis is a power within the Water Industry Act 1991 to protect essential services for the public if a private company is either on the brink of collapse, or not fulfilling its legal obligations.It arranges to transfer the business as a going concern and, just as administrators do in other financial collapses, it enables them to carry out the functions of the company until that transfer. Crucially it is designed to protect an essential public service first and creditors do not have priority in getting their loans paid off.The company can be eventually transferred to another private company, as in the case of the electricity company Bulb in 2022, when the government subsidised the continued existence of Bulb as a private company and then transferred it to another private company. But it can also be used to transfer a company into public ownership, as in the case of Railtrack. When the privatised company owning the railway network collapsed in 2002 the special administration process resulted in a transfer to public ownership under Network Rail.Public English regional water companyDavid Hall, an expert in public utilities after privatisation, suggests special administration could be used for all three of the failing water companies serving the south-east of England. Southern Water, South East Water and Thames Water could be taken into special administration and transferred into public ownership under the councils in the region as the first regional publicly owned water company.Enforcement under section 18 of the Water Industry ActUnder the Water Industry Act 1991, ministers and the regulator can issue enforcement orders for a company to do their bidding – whether it is paying down debts, restructuring, reducing payouts to shareholders or keeping water bills down. Nevertheless, this could result in ministers being involved in the running of the company for many years – effectively a nationalisation under the definition of the National Statistics Office, but without any local accountability and participation. It could be strongly resisted by the private owners.Let Thames Water go bustThis endgame of a solution has been suggested as a way to take the company back into public ownership, by paying a penny for a collapsed company. But when water was privatised, there were safeguards to protect what is an essential public utility. Put simply, ministers and the regulator are not allowed to let this happen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This has been driven by public outrage and political takeup as a mainstream issue of the most visible symptoms of decades of underinvestment: raw sewage discharges.Ofwat told companies this year they could not pay out dividends if it meant their financial stability suffered. It is scrutinising more closely the financial viability of water companies, in particular the level of debt they hold compared with the company’s value, which in the case of Thames Water is an industry high at 80%.As a result of Ofwat pressure, the scandal of sewage discharges and the need to invest in infrastructure, shareholders are being asked to stump up more money to support Thames Water and plug – according to some insiders – a £10bn funding gap. So far they have provided £500m and promised a further £1bn.\n",

      "Input text: Authorities in eastern Switzerland have ordered residents of the village of Brienz to evacuate by Friday evening because geologists say a mass of 2m cubic metres of Alpine rock looming overhead could break loose and spill down in coming weeks.Local leaders told a town hall and press event on Tuesday that residents would have to leave by 6pm on Friday but could return to the village from time to time starting on Saturday, depending on the risk level, but not stay overnight.Officials said measurements indicated a “strong acceleration over a large area” in recent days, and “up to 2m cubic metres of rock material will collapse or slide in the coming seven to 24 days”.The centuries-old village straddles German- and Romansch-speaking parts of the eastern Graubünden region, sitting south-west of Davos at an altitude of about 1,150 metres (3,800ft). Today it has fewer than 100 residents. Locals said the mountain and the rocks on it had been moving since the last ice age, according to officials.Over the last century, the village itself has moved a few centimetres each year – but the movement has accelerated over the last 20 years, and the landslide has now been moving about one metre a year. Geological surveys suggest the situation has become even more precarious.Melting glaciers in Alps threaten biodiversity of invertebrates, says studyRead moreChristian Gartmann, a member of the crisis management board in the town of Albula, which counts Brienz in its municipality, said experts estimated there was a 60% chance that the rock would fall in smaller chunks, which may not even reach the village or the valley. It could also move slowly. But there was also a 10% chance the whole 2m cubic metres mass may tumble down – threatening lives, property and the village itself, he said.“We hope that the village stays intact,” he said by phone. “We can’t eliminate the possibility that it [the rock] will come down … It could damage the village or destroy it.”Gartmann said that glacier melt had affected the precariousness of the rocks over millennia but that glacier melt due to human-made climate change in recent decades was not a factor.Experts deemed that a controlled explosion to set off a rockslide was too dangerous because it would require drilling underneath the rock – itself a hazardous operation, Gartmann said. Erecting a giant pile of sand or a wall to try to block any spillage was not considered feasible, he said, adding that the wall would have to be at least 70 metres high to protect the village.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s just one of those things that shows what you take for granted, all the invisible services we rely on.”\n",

      "The Transport Workers’ Union filed a lawsuit in the federal court this week, seeking maximum penalties of up to $125,000 against the waste management firm Cleanaway.Cleanaway is contracted by the City of Sydney council, which is expecting more than 78,000 people to descend on to its streets in the coming days as part of WorldPride, the world’s largest LGBTQ+ event.The union alleges that the company, which is the target of the strikes, stalled proposed industrial action last year by failing to comply with the terms of orders issued by the Fair Work Commission that would have allowed members at its Erskine Park and Hillsdale sites to vote on which protests they wanted to take part in.The commission has accepted a proposal to hold a hearing next Wednesday in an attempt to find a solution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are Australia’s global city, with the highest density population, and our waste collection is paramount – especially in the lead-up to WorldPride where we will once again be on the global stage.”Moore said the cleaning teams that maintain public spaces are internal and their operations won’t be affected by the strike.“We will also have additional teams working hard during Sydney WorldPride to keep the city clean, particularly before and after major events,” she said.\n",

      "Input text: The Middle Eastern herb za’atar, which is also known as Syrian oregano, or Origanum syriacum, grows across the Levant and has a unique and intoxicating flavour similar to thyme and marjoram, but with a broader, longer leaf. Za’atar is most commonly known, however, as a spice mix that contains the herb, usually combined with sesame seeds, cumin, coriander and sumac, and that has a sour, citrus twang.Like many others, Acme Fire Cult, a barbecue restaurant in east London founded by chefs Daniel Watkins and Andrew Clarke, makes its own za’atar-style spice mix, which is a brilliant way to use up surplus herbs and herb stalks.Za’atar-style spice mixI have never seen the fresh herb za’atar in the UK, but the spice mix of the same name is a super-versatile condiment, seasoning and marinade that can elevate all kinds of dishes. It’s often used to flavour flatbreads or to marinate meat and vegetables – I love it sprinkled over almost any simple meal, from a salad to a roast dinner or stew. This recipe, based on one from Daniel Watkins, is remarkably similar to the classic herb-and-spice mixture and very satisfying to make – just a small bunch of rescued herb stalks and/or surplus soft herbs will yield a decent little jar of this magical Levantine seasoning. It will keep for up to a year, too.Makes About 15 tbsp100g surplus herbs and/or herb stalks25g sesame seeds2½ tsp cumin seeds2½ tsp coriander seeds3 tsp dried thyme, marjoram or oregano, or a combination of all three5 tsp sumac3 tsp flaky sea saltBlanch the herbs in boiling water for 15 seconds, then drain and transfer to a bowl of iced water. Drain again, then put in a clean tea towel and squeeze dry. Roughly chop the herbs then spread them out on a baking tray and leave in a warm spot to dry for a few days (or dry them in the residual heat of the oven after using it for another purpose). Once dry, grind to a coarse powder in a mortar, spice grinder or blender, then tip into a small bowl.Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan until they start to brown, then add to the herb bowl. In the same pan, toast the cumin and coriander seeds until they begin to pop and smell aromatic, then grind to a medium-fine powder and add to the herb bowl. Stir in the dried thyme, marjoram or oregano (or combination of all three), the sumac and the salt, then decant into a clean jar and seal. The mix will keep for up to a year.\n",

      "Input text: Victorians face a more than doubling of transmission charges on electricity bills if the state government proceeds with plans for what is likely to be the most costly and longest single power line in Australia’s history, a thinktank says in a new report.The report by the Victoria Energy Policy Centre (VEPC) argues the proposed 500 kilovolt VNI West transmission line linking Melbourne’s outskirts with Wagga Wagga on an 800km path will be far costlier than alternatives and faces extensive landholder opposition. It also will not solve grid bottlenecks holding back new solar and windfarms in the state.The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), which first proposed VNI West as a $2.7bn project in 2018 and is Victoria’s main planner for transmission, estimated users’ transmission charges would need to rise by a quarter. That assessment, though, was based on 2021 prices and ignored interest costs that have since soared.Victoria announces ban on gas connections to new homes from January 2024Read moreThe report estimates the Victorian portion of the line alone will cost $4.9bn in current dollars. Add in a further $3bn needed for upgrades to the existing 220kV networks to integrate VNI West, and the full cost could swell to $11bn and lift Victorians’ transmission charges by at least 124%.“The cost has blown out again and again and again,” said Bruce Mountain, the VEPC’s director and one of the report’s authors. “Aemo rightfully should long since have said, ‘We need to think again, this is not getting anywhere.’”\n",

      "The falling price of renewables has offered nations endowed with lots of wind and sunshine potentially low-cost ways to decarbonise their economies. However, planning the transition is proving to be challenging, while the global rush to introduce new technologies to head off global heating means equipment prices are rocketing.Victoria’s energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the government would consider the report “but rigorous analysis by Aemo shows that VNI-West provides value to Victorian energy consumers, helping to keep the lights on across the state as our ageing coal-fired generators close”.“New transmission is vital for securing affordable and reliable renewable energy for Victorians – these projects will form part of the national electricity grid, allowing 3.4GW of new renewable generation to be built in Victoria,” D’Ambrosio said, adding that state agency Vicgrid was “already providing greater oversight of the [Western Renewables Link] and VNI West projects”.Merryn York, an Aemo executive general manager, said the agency had addressed the centre’s claims previously. Such reports created “on-going confusion and concern for landholders and communities”.“Our consultation process for VNI West involved hundreds of stakeholders to identify a preferred option that is forecast to deliver $1.4bn in net market benefits, and harness 3,400 megawatts of renewable generation in Victoria – enough to meet the annual electricity needs for approximately 2.3m homes,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The onus was also on the agency to demonstrate how the VNI West plan squared with Victoria’s target of sourcing 95% of its electricity from renewables by 2035.VNI West, too, implied Victoria would need to rely on New South Wales for much of its electricity even though its northern neighbour was potentially in an even more precarious power position as ageing coal plants exit the grid, Mountain said.\n",

      "Input text: Putting more electric trucks on Australian roads would cut transport pollution faster than electric cars could and governments should introduce grants and zero-emission zones to accelerate their adoption, a new report recommends.The study, from the logistics firm Adiona Tech, also found that replacing 10 delivery trucks with electric models would have the same impact as putting 56 electric cars on the road.Labor’s electric vehicle policy drives Australia forward – but not far | Adam MortonRead moreThe findings come as freight and industry transport bodies called on the federal government to develop a dedicated policy to support electric trucks after its national electric vehicle strategy failed to address larger modes of transport.Adiona Tech’s chief executive, Richard Savoie, said electrifying the largest vehicles on Australian roads should be considered “low-hanging fruit” by the government as swapping diesel trucks with electric models would significantly cut pollution.\n",

      "“Australia is already behind every other developed nation on electric vehicles and while we’re playing catch-up we can’t forget the biggest emitters on the road: freight and transport vehicles,” he said.“Australia must prioritise the electrification of these vehicles that are on the road most, travel the longest distances and are the least fuel-efficient.”The Connected Thinking report found 200 lithium batteries could cut more emissions when used to power light commercial vehicles, such as vans, than passenger cars, and just 10 electric delivery trucks would have the impact of 56 electric cars based on distance travelled, fuel efficiency and emissions.Large, articulated trucks also created 15% of transport emissions even though they made up 1% of the vehicle fleet, it found, as they travelled six times as far as passenger cars, used 40 times more fuel, and produced 50 times more pollution.The report called for grants to help businesses electrify truck fleets and for the introduction of “low or zero-emissions zones” where petrol and diesel vehicles would face restrictions or charges.“The national EV strategy is a start but we need low-emissions zones yesterday,” Savoie said.The report was released on the same day the Electric Vehicle Council, the Australian Trucking Association, the Heavy Vehicle Industry Association and the Australian Hydrogen Council joined a call for the development of a “national zero-emission truck strategy”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "Input text: Mammals that live in groups generally have longer lifespans than solitary species, new research into nearly 1,000 different animals suggests.Scientists from China and Australia compared 974 mammal species, analysing longevity and how they tended to be socially organised.Classifying mammals into three categories – solitary, pair-living and group-living – the researchers found that animals who lived in groups, such as elephants and zebras, tended to live longer on average than solitary species such as the aardvark and eastern chipmunk.How rehoming wildlife from rhinos to bison can revive threatened speciesRead moreThe correlation held even when the researchers took into account a link between larger species size and longer lifespan.The maximum lifespan of mammals varies from about two years in shrews to more than 200 years in bowhead whales.Northern short-tailed shrews – which are solitary animals – and group-living greater horseshoe bats are similar in weight, for example, but live to a maximum of around two and 30 years respectively.The researchers also conducted genetic analysis for 94 species, and identified 31 genes that were associated with both social organisation and longevity.The genes were primarily immunity- and hormone-related, the latter of which the study’s authors say could play a role in social behaviour.The study’s authors hypothesise that “group living reduces extrinsic mortality by limiting the risks of predation and starvation, and the strong and stable social bonds formed among group members have the power to enhance longevity”.“These benefits are expected to override the costs inherent in group living, such as competition for mating partners and food, stress from higher ranking individuals, and the spread of infectious diseases via social contacts,” they wrote.Previous research into specific group-living species, such as chacma baboons, has found that individuals with strong social bonds lived longer than those with weaker and less stable relationships. Scientists have documented similar findings in rhesus macaques.But sociality seems to play a different role in animals that don’t necessarily live in groups. A 2018 paper in yellow-bellied marmots – a “socially flexible” species – linked strong social relationships to decreased longevity.Whether longevity confers any evolutionary advantage is contentious. Assoc Prof Celine Frere, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Queensland who was not involved in the research, said some short-lived animals reproduced much faster than longer-living species.‘Group living reduces extrinsic mortality by limiting the risks of predation and starvation,’ the study’s authors wrote. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images“From an evolutionary context, what an individual seeks to do is to pass on its genes to future generations,” she said. “An animal that lives two years versus a whale that lives 200 years most likely have produced the same amount of offspring across their lifetimes.”Frere said the study’s findings were interesting but that its categorisation of species as being solitary, pair-living or group-living was a “simplistic approach to look at social organisation”. Animals bred in captivity develop physical changes that may hinder survival in the wild, research findsRead more“They want to imply that group-living species live longer. But it’s much more complicated than that. [Lifespan] is tied to their ecology. It’s tied to their reproductive biology, it’s tied to their mating system.“Whether you’re a solitary animal or a group-living animal, you have to learn to live with others … and you will compete with others for access to resources.”Frere added that social organisation varied significantly among group-living mammals, ranging from highly structured dominance hierarchies to fission-fusion societies, in which the size and makeup of social groups change over time.The research was published in the journal Nature Communications.\n",

      "Input text: Ministers have been told they will be “punished” by voters after analysis revealed the decline of vital flood defences across England.The proportion of critical assets in disrepair has almost trebled in the West Midlands and the east of England since 2018, leaving thousands of homes and businesses more vulnerable to storms.Critical assets are defined as those where there is a high risk to life and property if they fail.The east of England, which spans the Conservative heartlands from Suffolk to Bedfordshire and Essex, has one of the highest proportion of rundown flood defences in England, with nearly one in 11 – more than 850 assets – considered “poor” or “very poor” by Environment Agency inspectors.Chart showing percentage decline in condition of flood defences classed as poor or very poor in English regionsSteve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, said: “The Conservatives’ sticking-plaster approach to flooding has left communities devastated and cost the economy billions of pounds.”Using Environment Agency data obtained by Greenpeace’s investigative arm, Unearthed, the Guardian tracked the state of England’s vital flood defences from 2018 to 2022.The analysis revealed a sharp rise in the proportion of critical assets in disrepair across many parts of the country.In the east Midlands, which was deluged by Storm Babet in October, the proportion of flood defences in the worst conditions has almost doubled in the last five years.Together with the east of England, the north-west has the highest rate of flood defences so damaged they are almost useless, with one in 11 defences considered in disrepair in 2022 – more than 815 – up from one in 16 in 2018.In the West Midlands, the rate of ruined assets has risen from one in 44 in 2018 to one in 14 last year.The number of damaged flood defences has increased across all regions in the last five years. However, the analysis examined the proportion of flood defences in disrepair rather than the number because thousands more assets have been built since 2018.Experts said the picture of disrepair was likely to worsen after higher costs and budget shortfalls forced the Environment Agency to axe a quarter of its new flood defence projects.Georgia Whitaker, Greenpeace UK’s climate campaigner, said the analysis painted a “grim and desperate picture”.Graph plotting state of district flood defences v level of flood riskShe said there was “absolutely no excuse for this lack of preparation” from the government, and added: “If politicians fail to commit to crucial climate action, they risk being punished at the ballot box.”In total, 4,204 of England’s most important flood defences were in a poor or very poor condition in 2022. This accounts for about one in 15 of the total, up from the one in 25 registered four years ago.Of these, 856 were judged very poor, meaning they had “severe defects resulting in complete performance failure”, essentially rendering them useless.The remaining 3,348 were in poor condition, meaning they have defects that would “significantly reduce” their performance.The government’s environment department (Defra) claimed that more than 61,500 flood defences met the required condition and that 2,400 did not, but the Guardian has not been able to verify this data.A spokesperson said mitigation measures, such as increased inspections, would be put in place when assets were not found to be in the right standard.Defra said: “Flooding can be devastating to communities – which is why we are investing a record £5.2bn between 2021 and 2027 to better protect hundreds of thousands of properties, including over £200m a year for maintaining of flood defences.”The Environment Agency has slashed the number of homes it expects to protect from flooding over the next five years as higher costs have forced it to scale back projects.A National Audit Office report last month said the agency had pledged to protect 336,000 properties from the risk of flooding by 2027 – but that this had been cut to 200,000 – a reduction of 40%.The Environment Agency also removed 500 of the 2,000 new flood defence projects originally included in its six-year flood and coastal erosion programme.\n",

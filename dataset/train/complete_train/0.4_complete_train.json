However, demand for treated mains water, which takes time to process and deliver, was greater than we could meet,” he said.One South East Water customer accused Mr Hinton of “victim-blaming” and described his letter as “a deflection from the real issue”.",

But what are the options for the country’s largest water and sewerage company?Special administrationThis is a power within the Water Industry Act 1991 to protect essential services for the public if a private company is either on the brink of collapse, or not fulfilling its legal obligations.It arranges to transfer the business as a going concern and, just as administrators do in other financial collapses, it enables them to carry out the functions of the company until that transfer. Crucially it is designed to protect an essential public service first and creditors do not have priority in getting their loans paid off.The company can be eventually transferred to another private company, as in the case of the electricity company Bulb in 2022, when the government subsidised the continued existence of Bulb as a private company and then transferred it to another private company. But it can also be used to transfer a company into public ownership, as in the case of Railtrack.

But customers could face shortfalls, particularly if cold weather coincided with low levels of renewable energy generation.“The risk of gas shortfalls each year from winter 2023 to 2026 in all southern jurisdictions remains under extreme weather conditions and periods of high gas-powered electricity generation, with those risks further exacerbated if gas storage levels are insufficient,” said Aemo’s chief executive, Daniel Westerman.Most Australian states face sharp power bill rises, despite government’s interventionRead more“While production capacity commitments have increased for 2023 compared to the 2022 GSOO and several key infrastructure projects are on track for delivery, there is forecast to be a 16% reduction in production capacity this winter compared to 2022 in Victoria, which increases supply pressure in the southern regions,” he said.Although Australia is one of the world’s largest producers of gas, most of the supply in the eastern states is earmarked for export.

Owners of the most polluting cars can expect to pay more than twice as much as cleaner cars. There are now 26 different charges to park for an hour in Lambeth, depending on a car’s tax band and whether there is a diesel surcharge. The cost of a parking bay near Waterloo station in south London now ranges between £6.30 and £13.23 an hour, with payment made by an app.The consultation on the charges introduced on 30 May included a new pricing structure for residents’ parking permits, which are already based on CO2 emissions. The annual cost of the highest band has risen from £340.73 to £500, with an additional annual surcharge of £140 for a diesel vehicle that does not comply with Euro 6 emission standards.Of more than 2,900 responses in the consultation, 59% objected to the proposals. Lambeth has implemented the changes despite opposition, stating that air quality is a major public health issue and a wide range of interventions is required.The drive to reduce car journeys and create what are known as 15-minute cities (in which key local facilities are within 15 minutes walk or cycle from someone’s home) has created divisions in many neighbourhoods.",

Fertiliser prices more than tripled, from £233 a tonne in 2020 to £766 a tonne in 2022, which farmers say led to a reduction in their use.Data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) published last week revealed that for key crops – wheat, barley, oilseed rape and sugar beet – fertiliser use decreased by an average of 27% compared with the 2010-19 average. Despite this, yields of those crops were 2.4% above average compared with the same period.An exception to the trend was the 10% increase in the use of fertilisers in the cultivation of potatoes, with a 8.6% reduction in yield.Fertiliser use in agriculture is a major cause of pollution. In 2022, Defra found that pressure from agriculture accounted for 40% of pollution in inland water bodies. They estimated that 50% of nitrate pollution, 25% of phosphorus in the water environment and 75% of sediment pollution came from agriculture.Martin Lines, the chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), a group of farmers who campaign for sustainability in the industry, said the data showed how reduced fertiliser usage “can bring big benefits to the business and beyond”.While the “alarming” price rises of fertiliser came as a “real shock” to farmers, Lines said, the minimal impact on yield was unsurprising.",

Five years ago last week, Extinction Rebellion was launched in Parliament Square. Back then, a principal term of criticism lobbied at XR was that it was “alarmist”. Five years on, it’s plainly visible that it was not.In the past few months the process of climatic decline has dramatically accelerated, and we are exceeding many of the supposed worst-case scenarios laid out in climate models. We are plainly hurtling towards 1.5C of global over-heat, long before most seemingly well-informed people thought we would.And yet despite this, our climate protest movement in the UK today is nowhere near strong enough to force a change of course. XR’s “scare-mongering” over the existential threat facing us may have been decisively vindicated, but it was never able to recover its reputation from the Canning Town incident in October 2019, when rebels inexplicably stopped underground trains running – to much public criticism. Since then, it has struggled to assert itself as a credible vehicle for truly mass mobilisation.Many significant organisations and movements have emerged in its wake. The most attention-grabbing have been from the recent, even more radical flank of the UK’s climate movement – first Insulate Britain and then Just Stop Oil – who have blocked the M25, stopped test matches and much more. To me, these activists are obviously on the right side of history. But at the same time, many in the broader climate movement now feel that action that disrupts the general public has become counterproductive – as XR came to learn.

Now, they are “seriously threatened with extinction”, according to the Washington fish and wildlife commission (FWS).A nine-member panel voted unanimously last week to adopt a recommendation from the agency’s conservation assessment manager, Taylor Cotten, to reclassify western gray squirrels for the first time since they were placed on the threatened species list in 1993.“Some species come and go, and the problem with so many species right now is the pace at which we are losing them,” commissioner Tim Ragen said during a public meeting earlier this month.“One of the distinctions we want to draw is whether or not they’re coming and going due to natural factors versus human-related factors. This one is a case where human-related factors are clearly involved.",

The peer said in a letter to supporters of the Atlantic Salmon Trust, which he chaired: “Difficulties do remain with a lack of understanding of the impact of predation by increasing numbers of fish-eating birds and a burgeoning seal population – all enjoying protection by law.”Experts disagree that shooting seals protects salmon. Hugo Tagholm, executive director of Oceana UK, said overfishing, salmon farming and poor water quality are drivers of salmon decline, not seals which evolved alongside salmon: “It is these issues we should be focused on, not shooting our seals. The UK can be proud of the fact that it is home to internationally important populations of seals. But they need our protection: since they are slow to reproduce and vulnerable to the climate crisis and disease, any increase in adult mortality can quickly affect a population, destroying a keystone species of our rich marine wildlife.”Douglas-Miller was made a baron on Friday in a surprise appointment as an environment minister and given the portfolio responsibility for animal welfare this week.",

It’s why Hipkins on Monday ditched not just expensive climate policies like the “cash for clunkers” scrappage scheme, but also the drive to lower speed limits in many parts of the country to increase road safety.We can’t afford to choose adaptation over cutting emissions – suggesting otherwise is dangerous | James ShawRead moreIt’s not that the government couldn’t lower speeds and fix storm-damaged roads at the same time – our transport agency has around 2,400 staff – it’s that Hipkins doesn’t want to talk about lowering the speed limit.

The most toxic form of dioxin is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin or TCDD. TCDD is more commonly recognized as the toxic contaminant found in Agent Orange and at Love Canal, New York and Times Beach, Missouri, both sites of two of the most tragic environmental catastrophes in US history.Dioxin is not deliberately manufactured.

Following the privatisation of water companies in 1989, owners have enriched themselves while neglecting infrastructure and dumping vast quantities of untreated sewage. As investors have loaded water companies with debt, they have continued to pay dividends to their shareholders, which totalled £1.4bn last year. The public, meanwhile, have shouldered the costs.

Details on how the new global fund should operate are still to be worked out this year, but it must include some form of provision for migration, experts told the Guardian.“There is no doubt that some of the drivers of refugee numbers are conflict and climate change,” said Miliband. “Climate change has a direct and indirect effect on migration, and forced migration. It generally leads to internal displacement, to migration flows within countries.”About 55 million people around the world are internally displaced within their own countries, more than the number who are fleeing across borders.",

Could the enforced immobility of life under Covid-19, the rediscovery of neighbourhood shops, parks and walks brought about by the closure of workplaces and schools, lead to a longer-term adjustment – a new car/life balance?For decades, green thinkers and politicians have advocated for a less automobile-centric culture. Transport policy unites two big themes of environmental politics: the idea that many people need to be reconnected with local geographies, both physical and human; and opposition to pollution. This means greenhouse gases, of course, but also particulate matter and noise. An altered transport hierarchy, it has long been argued, is beneficial to health, since more walking and cycling means less obesity, respiratory illness and heart disease; reduced road traffic also means fewer injuries and deaths caused by collisions.The need for cuts in air pollution and carbon emissions (with levels in many UK cities exceeding legal limits), combined with the practical urgency of the situation earlier this year, in which public transport use had to be reduced without increasing congestion, made walking and cycling the only good option.",

It has a chorus of grunts, growls and barks and engages in an elaborate set of mating dances, including the “weed dance” where the birds offer each other water weed and the “ghostly penguin” where they rise chest to chest.The competition, run by environmental organisation Forest & Bird, normally attracts just under 60,000 votes but this year those figures leapt to 350,000 across 195 countries, with 290,374 of those going to the pūteketeke.",

Pups are weaned after just four days – the shortest period of any mammal.The seals are silver grey with charcoal faces and dark spots on their flanks, with fur pelts that have made them attractive to humans for coats and hats. Their pups are about one metre long at birth and have blue-grey backs that later develop into their leopard-like spots. Normally the seals follow the drifting pack ice off Arctic coasts such as east Greenland, from where this pair probably came. But now the warming seas are causing ice to melt, and their home territories are becoming unsustainable.The result is that unusual visitors such as these are appearing more frequently.

A third by Etihad offered potential customers “total peace of mind”, mentioning their environmental advocacy.

We also understood that there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry that would adequately substantiate absolute green claims,” read the ruling against Etihad.It is the second time this year that Lufthansa and Etihad have fallen foul of UK marketing rules.Lufthansa, which promised it would stop using the slogan “fly more sustainably”, said a paid-for Google ad did not provide space for a full explanation of “green fares” but that consumers could follow a link for more information supporting its ad claims.Etihad said after receiving notification of the complaint, it had removed all references to “environmental advocacy” from its Google adverts in the UK.

But … these amazing abilities are in the open space where we see them.

Some people applauded the move as they thought it would favourably shift public opinion, while others insisted public disruption needs to remain a primary tactic to garner wider attention.Unfortunately, both camps are missing the point – once you have enough dedicated activists, the public is largely irrelevant to achieving political change. It is not the opinion, or even attention, of the public that matters, it is whether or not you are disrupting structures of power. Historical social movements have shown this repeatedly.Despite what we may like to believe in a democracy, public opinion is only one small influence on the government. It may theoretically give governments a mandate to act, but real change must first overcome powerful opposition from the structures that support governments, such as business and the legal and financial systems.

The government, however, appears to have other ideas. Having previously frozen funding for the Canal & River Trust (CRT) – the charity that in 2012 took over the management of 2,000 miles of state-owned canals – ministers now plan cuts of over £300m to its finances, beginning in 2027.As the CRT is forced to seek alternative sources of cash, this shortsighted decision will stretch resources beyond breaking point.",

There was a “shocking gap”, it reported, in policymaking to drive better insulation of homes. Progress on reducing farming emissions had been “glacial”. The bald conclusion was that the “current strategy will not deliver net zero” by 2050, as legally required.Given Rishi Sunak’s failure to include the government’s net zero strategy in his five key priorities for this year – and the prime minister’s reluctance to turn up at the November Cop27 summit in Egypt – it is perhaps no surprise that the sense of drift continues.

An attempt to include it as a late amendment to the recent Public Order Act 2023 failed to pass the Lords in January.Braverman told MPs on Wednesday the new powers would enable police to take quicker action against slow-walking protests and those that brought “chaos to the law-abiding majority”.But in its pre-action letter, the first step to a judicial review, Liberty said her move violated the constitutional principle of the separation of powers, because the measures had already been rejected by parliament.Katy Watts, a lawyer for the human rights organisation, said: “The home secretary has sidelined parliament to sneak in new legislation via the back door, despite not having the powers to do so.“This has been done deliberately in a way which enables the government to circumvent parliament – who voted these same proposals down just a few months ago – and is a flagrant breach of the separation of powers that exist in our constitution.“We’ve launched this legal action to ensure this overreach is checked, and that the government is not allowed to put itself above the law to do whatever it wants. It’s really important the government respects the law and that today’s decision is reversed immediately.”The Home Office confirmed it had received Liberty’s letter. A spokesperson said: “The right to protest is a fundamental part of our democracy but we must also protect the law-abiding majority’s right to go about their daily lives.",

The petrochemical industry, some governments and many environmental groups have pushed for improvements to the recyclability of plastic.Though some types of the material can be recycled, most cannot, and the study highlights how improving recyclability of the material comes with risks: it identified 853 chemicals used in PET recycled plastic and many of those have been discovered during the last two years.The most commonly detected were antimony and acetaldehyde, while potent toxins like 2,4-DTBP, ethylene glycol, lead, terephthalic acid, bisphenol and cyclic PET oligomers were also most frequently found.Moreover, the chemistries of plastics can be something of a black box. In the US, there’s very little regulation around what goes in the material and the EU only requires light testing to determine which chemicals are in plastic.The study characterizes plastics as “very complex materials containing hundreds of different, synthetic compounds which are more often than not poorly characterized for their hazard properties”.",

It states: “Allowing our town and village centres within protected landscapes (such as national parks) to benefit from the right could help ensure the longer-term viability and vitality of these community hubs, supporting the residents and businesses that rely on them.”It specifically cites the aim to give farmers the ability to change their agricultural buildings into houses: “We want to give farmers greater freedom to change the use of their existing buildings to residential use and support the delivery of new homes in rural communities.”However, national park chiefs have said the proposals are “bonkers” and could cause thousands of new developments to mar the views in some of England’s most beautiful areas.David Butterworth, the CEO of the Yorkshire Dales national park, told the Guardian: “If I was trying to devise a policy that would essentially lead to the destruction of Yorkshire Dales national park, this would be the policy.

Revive a stale loaf by sprinkling with a little water, placing on a lined baking sheet and into a low oven for a few minutes (or in the microwave in 30-second blasts). Alternatively, turn it into breadcrumbs (or do like the Italians and make pangrattato), use to thicken soups, such as pappa al pomodoro (Tuscan bread and tomato soup), ribollita and gazpacho, or use instead of pine nuts in a pesto; they’re the secret to thicker sauces, too.Leafy greens Some 40% of all bagged salad gets thrown away.",

Many locals suspect poachers took the pair for soup, but no one really knows – no turtle thieves were caught on park security cameras.“Anecdotally, we are aware that community members have discussed turtles allegedly being removed from this park, but we have not witnessed this occurring,” said parks department spokesperson Gregg McQueen. “NYC Parks has not directly received any specific accounts or 311 reports regarding people taking wildlife from Clove Lakes Park.”“Wildlife plays an important role in our city’s ecosystem, and it is vital that we do all we can to protect the animals that inhabit our city’s parks and green spaces. It is illegal to remove, harm, or kill animals in parks. If New Yorkers see this activity, they should call 911,” he added by email.But there’s little doubt that the disappearance of Shnappy, who was believed to be a male, and Jeffrey, believed to be a female, has left an emotional hole in Staten Island.“Jeffrey has been here, like, forever,” said Natacha Beck, a hostess at the Stone House, a restaurant and wedding venue overlooking the lake.",

But researchers say the plants are surprisingly enigmatic after discovering they don’t use conventional processes to track the sun across the sky.Over the course of a day, sunflowers follow the path of the sun overhead – a process known as heliotropism – with their heads tilting progressively westwards as a result of cells elongating on the east side of the stem.At night, cells elongate on the opposite side of the stems resulting in the heads reorienting themselves towards the east.However researchers say the processes behind the solar tracking are an unexpected mystery.“So many of our results were different than we anticipated,” said Prof Stacey Harmer, an author of the research at University of California, Davis.Many plants grow towards a light source – this is because when blue light receptors, called phototropins, are activated on the lighted side of the stem, they cause hormones called auxins to become concentrated on the other “dark” side.These auxins stimulate an elongation of cells, resulting in the stem bending towards the light.",

They believe the levy is needed to create a level playing field that would enable UK companies to invest in cutting their greenhouse gas emissions, without finding themselves undercut by lower-cost but higher-carbon imports from overseas.Jerome Mayhew, a Tory member of the environmental audit committee, is convinced the charge will prove popular in his party, despite misgivings among some of his colleagues. “Applying a cost to carbon unlocks the power of the free market to find cheaper, lower-carbon production techniques,” he told the Guardian. “As Conservatives, promoting free trade and free markets is within our DNA.”Manufacturers will face higher costs for investment in new equipment and processes as the UK moves to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Without a carbon levy, those companies trying to do the right thing would see their costs rise while imports from countries lacking stringent green regulations prospered, resulting in higher emissions overall and damaging the climate and the UK economy.With a carbon levy, known as a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), those overseas manufacturers, in countries such as China, would have an added incentive to cut their carbon footprints and join the green race.Traditionally, though, some Tories have taken the view that a charge on imports would be protectionist.",

Forster used the characters in his novels to put flesh on his arguments against the emotionally repressive code of the time.

At that conference, China pledged CO2 emissions would peak by 2030. Xi said that China would “strictly control coal-fired power generation projects”.But 2021 was also the year in which severe power outages blighted many parts of China, leading to rationing, closed factories and cold homes as local authorities struggled to cope with sudden shortages of energy.In 2022, further energy crunches in south-west China underlined the importance of stable energy supplies to Chinese officials. That has put the commitment to reduce reliance on coal-fired energy in direct tension with the new emphasis on energy security.“Chinese officials view coal as the primary guarantee of energy security,” said Anders Hove, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “For this reason, it is now considered sensitive to criticise the country’s present investments in coal.”Local governments in China approved 50.4GW of new coal power in the first half of 2023. And in 2022, construction started on 50GW of coal capacity, an amount six times as large as the rest of the world combined.Despite growing demand for energy, China still has far more coal power capacity than it needs.

Exposure to these tiny particles dominates the health harm from air pollution and is the leading environment risk factor for early death. PM2.5 comes from the burning of solid and liquid fuels, through power generation, domestic heating and motor traffic. It can also form in the air from chemical reactions between other pollutants.A growing body of research shows that these particulates are responsible for a huge range of health problems from lung and heart disease to diabetes and cancer, brain function to premature births. As well as leaving millions of people with life-limiting chronic health conditions, they also lead to the early death of more than 400,000 people across Europe each year. Experts say more than 200,000 of these could be saved if the air in Europe met World Health Organization guidelines.The current WHO guidelines state that annual average concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms a cubic metre (µg/m3).Gary FullerWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The underlying data for the Guardian’s air pollution in Europe investigation is sourced from the Expanse project, coordinated by the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, the Netherlands, with air quality modelling conducted in collaboration between Utrecht University and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute.",

It appears to be built on an alluvial fan – a cone-shaped feature of the landscape, formed over millennia by sediment deposition from the river. These features form where steep rivers exit mountain upland, spread out and split into a series of distributary channels down the fan (like a delta).In many cases around the world, as in Derna, the water flow has been engineered into a single, embanked channel on one flank of the fan and building allowed right up to its margins. In an extreme event, as has happened here, the enormous water flow has reverted to its natural pathways, overflowing the constrained channel and flowing in multiple pathways down the fan feature on which most of the town is built.Such locations are particularly vulnerable to the effects of extreme flows, and demonstrate the dangers of trying to control nature by large-scale channel diversion and embanking.

Yet within the first round of GOP questioning, led by one of the industry’s staunchest defenders, ranking committee member James Comer of Kentucky, the executives inadvertently proved why they were summoned to testify under oath in the first place.Comer asked each oil executive if they had “ever approved a disinformation campaign”. Then, one after another, the heads of Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP all repeated that no, they had never approved any such effort.Here’s the problem: that’s a lie.There can be no doubt that Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP have all engaged in false advertising, aka disinformation campaigns, during the tenure of their current CEOs. In fact, one could argue that the vast majority of the industry’s advertising fits this definition.Take Exxon. For years, Exxon has been spending millions of dollars to run ads about its investments in algae fuel, even though it has spent very little on the actual research and has no plan to bring the product to market. The company hopes to create a “net impression” among consumers that Exxon is in the business of climate solutions, when it’s really still in the business of climate destruction. It’s textbook false advertising – which is one reason Exxon is being taken to court for this disinformation.Or look at Chevron.",

The increased droughts are mirrored in northern Italy, and the research shows the number of intense dry spells experienced by both areas has more than doubled since 2000.But as part of what researchers describe as a “climate hazard flip”, the droughts in both regions are punctuated by extreme rainfall causing devastating flooding, which was experienced in the Lombardy region of Italy this summer.The research examined the frequency and magnitude of flooding and drought hazards over the past 41 years in locations across six countries: Pakistan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mozambique.

The poles will take a little longer – the ozone layer will fully bounce back by 2045 over the Arctic and by 2066 over the Antarctic.Following alarm over the loss of ozone in the 1980s, the ozone layer has been steadily improving in the wake of the 1989 Montreal protocol, an international agreement that has helped eliminate 99% of ozone-depleting chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that were used as solvents and refrigerants.The UN said the action taken on the ozone layer had also bolstered the more ponderous response to the climate crisis – CFCs are also greenhouse gases and their continued uncontrolled use would have raised global temperatures by as much as 1C by the middle of the century, worsening an already dire situation where planet-heating gases are still not declining.“Ozone action sets a precedent for climate action,” said Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, which unveiled the progress report, which is conducted every four years, on Monday. “Our success in phasing out ozone-eating chemicals shows us what can and must be done as a matter of urgency to transition away from fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gases and so limit temperature increase.",

This will have been news to much of the public, particularly those who remember the long years of Conservative austerity after 2010 and the Tory party’s self‑expulsion of Britain from the European Union after 2016. Neither of these dominant events of the last 13 years was a flagship social democratic policy last time we looked.Yet Ms Truss is almost right in one respect. The British public has been moving slowly and steadily in a more social democratic direction in recent years. The publication this week of the 40th annual British Social Attitudes survey provides some of the evidence. It reveals, for instance, that the public does not only want government to fund health care and pensions, it also wants it to reduce income differences between the rich and the poor. The public supports further increases in taxes and spending in order to fund public services too, in spite of the fact that taxes are already high by historic standards.These are significant findings.",

It also allows the public utility to build and own renewables while phasing out fossil fuels.“It’s a historic win for the climate and for clean jobs,” said Lee Ziesche, organizer with Public Power New York, a coalition that has been fighting to pass the legislation for the past four years. “It’ll create a model of public power for the whole country, and it’s really showing that our energy should be a public good.”The Build Public Renewables Act (BPRA) will ensure that all state-owned properties that ordinarily receive power from the New York power authority (NYPA) are run on renewable energy by 2030. It will also require municipally owned properties – including many hospitals and schools, as well as public housing and public transit – to switch to renewable energy by 2035.NYPA provides low-cost electricity to more than 1,000 customers, ranging from local and state government buildings to electric cooperatives, businesses and non-profits. It also sells a portion of its power on the wholesale market, where utilities can purchase it. The legislation will require NYPA to offer low-to-moderate income customers a lower utility rate for renewable energy.The passage of this first-of-its-kind law comes after years of grassroots campaigning by climate and environmental organizers in New York state.NYPA is the largest state public utility in the country. The vast majority of the electricity generated by NYPA comes from hydropower: over 80%. This new legislation will require the state to phase out the six natural gas-fired plants that NYPA operates across New York City by 2030.",

Those things are owed largely to the wildfires engulfing bigger parts of the state in bigger chunks of the year.California’s woes have a lot to do with the climate crisis, which fuels the hot, dry conditions that turn wooded hills into kindling. It’s also a political failure. Housing crises in the Golden state have pushed more and more people out of densely populated areas and into the so-called wildland-urban interface – places that are cheaper to live in, and more prone to burn. Wealthy homeowners in fire-prone enclaves are also reluctant to move, keen to keep rebuilding properties that keep getting destroyed.Similar dynamics are playing out around the country. Insurance companies are hiking up costs or wholly withdrawing from some areas after deadly, costly flooding in Appalachia and hurricanes in Louisiana and Florida, where property insurance rates are now roughly triple the national average. In each case the rich will make out all right, for now, able to pony up the cost of more expensive policies or relocation.",

When it came to the reverberating consequences of Russia’s manipulation of Europe’s fossil fuel insecurity, or to the weakening of the international cooperation necessary for coordinated global climate action, our guesses were no better than theirs.Two decades of international analysis and debate over the relationship between climate change and security has focused on how our rapidly destabilising climate could undermine the security of states.

The nature restoration law was announced alongside separate legislation proposing a crackdown on chemical pesticides with the aim of reversing the catastrophic loss of wildlife on the continent.But there is growing concern that the laws could be abandoned entirely amid opposition from agricultural, fishing and forestry lobbying groups, and some member states. On Tuesday, the European parliament’s agriculture committee voted to reject the nature restoration legislation, and the fisheries committee followed suit on Wednesday.The nature restoration law is a key part of the European green deal that is crucial to meeting international climate and biodiversity commitments. On Monday , the commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said there would not be another proposal.The law aims to reverse the decline of pollinating insects while restoring forests, marine areas and other ecosystems key to food production to improve Europe’s resilience to climatic shocks as the planet warms. It was a key part of the EU’s negotiating position at Cop15 in Montreal last year, where the world agreed to protect 30% of the planet for nature.",

His research there in 1965-66 anchored a lifetime devoted to understanding, explaining and advocating for poor rural people around the world.Rather than being backward and conservative as some supposed, such communities acted rationally and managed resources efficiently. In his paper The Theory of the Optimising Peasant (1968), Michael explained that poor, small farmers were often reluctant to adopt new varieties of wheat and rice such as those rolled out in the green revolution of the mid-20th century, despite the average yield being higher than that of traditional varieties. This was because when the new varieties failed, because of drought or disease, they did so more spectacularly than traditional varieties, and thus increased the risk of hunger and destitution. When later generations of the green revolution crops reduced the risk, poor farmers adopted them with enthusiasm.Michael also showed that in land-scarce situations, poor farmers managed the land more intensively and more efficiently than richer ones; and he debunked the idea that poor farmers were wasteful, showing that grain losses on farms were often minimal.These ideas helped overturn the idea that national development could only come via industrialisation, at the expense, usually via high taxation, of rural areas. Michael’s big book, Why Poor People Stay Poor: Urban Bias and World Development (1977), set out to map in detail the ways in which urban-focused elites and policymakers discriminated against the rural poor.In other work, Michael crossed the boundaries of disciplines to explore the linkages between agriculture, health and nutrition.",

But though many crops are affected by the summer’s intense heat and drought, apple trees are struggling because they need a period of cold over the winter.In autumn, they store enough energy to see them through the dormant period, and then burst into action again in spring. Perfect chilling hours for apples are those below 6C but above freezing, and most traditional apple trees need about 1,000 chilling hours. If temperatures remain above 6C then they have to respire, using up energy stores throughout the winter period, which in turn limits the stores available in spring, meaning fewer apples grow.Gala apples are a popular variety grown in New Zealand, but the horticulturalist Helena Dove, who runs Kew’s kitchen garden, said the breed may overtake traditional varieties in Britain.",

And, in this area, it’s probably going to be – for many, many farmers – devastating,” he said.“In other areas it will be good, but in this area, the breadbasket, it’s just … something that breaks my heart.”Afghanistan has had two brushes with the Moroccan locust in recent history, one in 1981, when an outbreak wiped out about a quarter of the national harvest, and another in 2003, when it claimed a more modest 8% due to a strengthened locust-control programme.However, since the Taliban overthrew Ashraf Ghani’s government, prompting foreign assistance to be cut off, the agriculture ministry’s locust-control programme has foundered.",

Peat bogs are Scotland’s largest carbon store.That combination of attributes means peatlands have long been an environmental cause celebre, and explains why even this most part-time, pallidly green of governments has at last seen a reason to protect them, with the most high-profile piece of legislation so far being a ban on peat products for domestic gardeners, which will see composting products – already pretty much infra dig – entirely absent from garden centres by the end of 2024.It’s also why the scotch whisky industry is starting to feel a little nervous about how long its own relationship with peat can continue. Don’t forget, whisky and peat go back centuries together, a partnership which, for lovers of a peaty dram, is as precious and remarkable as anything else to do with peat: when barley is malted above a peat fire, it gives the resulting whisky that distinctive, damp-earthy-smoky flavour which many would argue is the quintessence of scotch.As well as making the point that whisky accounts for only about 1% of the UK’s peat use, defending the cultural significance of this tradition has been the central pillar of the scotch industry’s case during the Scottish government’s consultation on its peat policy this year.

We will make sure that this will not be the case. Everyone needs to know this is not just about climate, polar bears and glaciers. This is about my lungs and your lungs.”Coal, oil and gas release toxic particles when burned that kill millions of people each year. Some of the emissions also heat the planet, making extreme weather more violent and increasing the chances of harvests failing and some diseases spreading.“Whether they like it or not – whether they know it or not – the negotiators at Cop are negotiating with our health,” said Neira.Doctors have started to shout louder about the damage that weak climate policies do to human health as scientific and medical evidence has mounted.",

More than 4,500 people died in England in 2022 due to high temperatures, which was the largest figure on record.

During the same 35-year period analysed, more than 2,000 people died in Wales due to the warm temperatures.Drawing on advice from experts from a range of organisations including the National Infrastructure Commission, the London School of Economics and the University of Oxford, the Fabians have drawn up a plan to prevent illness and death from the increasing extreme heat predicted to happen in the UK due to climate breakdown.These include introducing a specific maximum indoor working temperature law, including the ability to withdraw labour if workplace temperatures surpass 30C, or 27C if doing strenuous work.It found that “low-paid workers often lack sufficient access to water, can not escape the heat, and have to wear uniforms or personal protective equipment (PPE) designed for cooler temperatures.",

Dingoes are classified as native species in all jurisdictions on the Australian mainland.“It’s just not acceptable for a native species to be … killed in the manner that we’re doing in national parks – and that is happening pretty much all across the country,” Cairns said. “There is no other native animal that is managed the way dingoes are in Australia.”The letter to the NSW government details “extensive lethal control activities including aerial baiting, ground baiting, aerial shooting, ground shooting and trapping being carried out across national parks and conservation areas for the management of ‘wild dogs’”.“A lot of people think that dingoes are different from ‘wild dogs’ when the government use of the term includes dingoes,” Cairns said.“The terminology ‘wild dogs’ has been adopted because of concern that there’s a lot of hybridisation going on in populations. But the science is now saying: we don’t actually have that many of those mixed animals, there are basically no feral dogs and there are very few hybrids that have very little dingo ancestry.",

This was a decline from the previous year’s statistics that showed that 97% met the minimum standard of “sufficient”, while 93% met the highest standards of good and excellent.The vast majority of designated bathing sites are coastal, and only three rivers in England have the special designation for swimming: the River Wharfe at Ilkley, Wolvercote Mill Stream in Oxfordshire and the Deben estuary at Waldringfield. All three have been given poor status, meaning people should not swim in them and risk getting sick if they do. Sewage spills and agricultural runoff mean that swimming sites can carry E coli and intestinal enterococci, which would make swimmers ill.Many European countries designate a far greater number rivers as swimming areas. In France, for example, there are more than 570 river bathing sites.The chief executive of the campaign group River Action, James Wallace, said: “Only three rivers have designated bathing water status and they are all rated poor, the worst rating possible. Sadly, that tells its own story, that the UK’s rivers are in a very fragile state. Today, only 14% of the UK’s rivers are considered healthy.

In a separate report published on Tuesday, Climate Action Tracker (CAT) raised its projections slightly for future warming above the estimates it made at a conference in Glasgow two years ago.Graphic“Two years after Glasgow, our report is virtually the same,” said Claire Stockwell, an analyst at Climate Analytics and lead author of the CAT report. “You would think the extreme events around the world would be sparking action but governments appear oblivious, somehow thinking treading water will deal with the flood of impacts.”As carbon clogs the atmosphere, trapping sunlight and baking the planet, the climate is growing more hostile to human life. The growth in CO2 emissions had slowed substantially over the past decade, the Global Carbon Project found, but the amount emitted each year had continued to rise. It projected that total CO2 emissions in 2023 would reach a record high of 40.9 gigatons.If the world continued to emit CO2 at that rate, the international team of more than 120 scientists found, it would burn through the remaining carbon budget for a half-chance of keeping global heating to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures in just seven years.

When I investigated the pollution sources in the 2019 and 2020 dataset, I also found arsenic among the chemicals from wood smoke.”Despite clear messages from government and local councils, a survey for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2018-19 revealed that about 9% of people who burned wood at home were burning waste wood.The problem is that construction wood is normally treated with preservatives to protect against insects and fungi. Before 2006 the preservatives used in the UK frequently contained arsenic. This arsenic becomes part of the ash and smoke when the wood is burned.The survey found examples of people burning fence panels, pallets, old furniture, doors, door frames and construction wood salvaged from skips. One woman described how her husband collected waste wood from skips using a wheelbarrow.Many people in the survey did not know what types of wood might be treated and others justified their behaviour as harmless because they only did it occasionally. Another mistakenly thought their Defra-approved stove would remove any toxins.And this problem is not isolated to London. Dr James Allan, who operates Manchester University’s air research site, said: “We see arsenic in Manchester as well, associated with cold weather and the black carbon that you get from wood-burning.”In Auckland, New Zealand, scientists have been investigating if people in the city were being exposed to arsenic from wood-heating.",

But new research suggests that by eating some parts of the coral and then pooing in different areas of the reef, they are part of a cycle that redistributes beneficial microbes that can help coral thrive.“Corallivorous fish are generally regarded as harmful because they bite the corals. But it turns out that this doesn’t tell the whole story,” said Dr Carsten Grupstra, of Rice University, the lead author of the study. “They often get a bad rep, and lots of scientists see them as damaging. But I hope this work shows that they can be a part of a healthy ecosystem.“Corallivore faeces contain many of the bacterial taxa that associate with healthy corals under normal conditions, potentially resulting in the natural dispersal of ‘coral probiotics’, analogous to faecal microbiota transplantation therapy in humans.”This means that when some fish faeces interact with coral colonies on the reef, and these microorganisms are transferred from the poo to a new coral colony, they can be beneficial to that new coral colony.",

But, despite their importance, there has been no long-term monitoring of soil invertebrates.To fill the gap, researchers collated data from more than 100 different smaller studies ranging from 1928 to 2018.

But when responsibility for emissions in countries once under the British empire’s rule is given to the UK, the figure rises to more than 5%.These additional emissions come largely from the destruction of forests in the colonised countries, with the biggest contributors coming from India, Myanmar and Nigeria before their independence.The analysis by Carbon Brief moves up the UK from eighth to fourth in the list of nations with the biggest historical emissions, behind the US, China and Russia.The climate crisis, which has led to temperature records being shattered in 2023, is predominantly the result of carbon emissions from rich nations. However, the worst impacts of intensifying extreme weather are hitting poorer nations, which have very low emissions.The issue of responsibility features strongly in the international UN climate negotiations, which resume again at Cop28 in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.It is especially important in debate over the provision of climate finance to developing nations.

The UK’s 10 warmest years have all occurred since 2003.Globally, 2023 is expected to have been the planet’s hottest year on record, driven by carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere that are at their highest for at least 2m years and the return of the Pacific Ocean phenomenon known as El Niño.“The observations of the UK climate are clear,” said Mike Kendon, at the Met Office. “Climate change is influencing UK temperature records over the long term, with 2023 going down as another very warm year.”“2023 also had more than its fair share of rain, with impactful storms like Babet and Ciarán influencing the figures,” he said. “Climate projections suggest an increase in the frequency of hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters.

But coffee, like many other crops, is under threat due to the climate crisis – subject to diseases, droughts and extreme weather conditions.Most of the coffee consumed worldwide comes from two species – arabica and robusta. Accounting for 70% of global coffee production, the arabica bean is more popular and for a good reason. Its smoother flavor, lower acidity and fruity hints rank paramount to robusta’s grainy, more bitter flavor. Native to Ethiopia and predominantly grown in Central and South America, arabica is the only bean that Starbucks uses in its nearly 37,000 locations worldwide. But its sensitivity to rising temperatures makes it especially vulnerable to premature ripening and crop loss.“More researchers doing work that will provide climate resilient varieties is critical,” said Sarada Krishnan, a coffee grower and scientist at the Crop Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to conserving crop diversity.

The policies contained in the energy plan announced on Thursday are dangerous. They will significantly worsen the climate crisis that threatens to engulf us all, if the globally agreed target of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is missed. Mr Sunak’s record on green policies in the Treasury was dismal. As prime minister, he is steering the UK even further away from the course towards speedy decarbonisation that we should be on. In the long term, climate will surely top the list of public policy failures during this long period of Tory government.Hundreds of leading scientists wrote to Mr Sunak’s government this week, calling for an end to new oil and gas developments. The government is set to defy them with plans for a huge North Sea oilfield, which it attempts to justify on the grounds that it is investing £20bn (over 20 years) in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, in order to limit the damage caused. The scientists are right. The politicians and their fossil fuel industry backers are wrong. It is devastating that the UK is now trashing its own reputation for pioneering climate laws, which made national emissions reductions compulsory.

Since the late 1970s, when the government began what has turned into a long-term land privatisation programme, about half of all public land – 2 million hectares in total, or 10% of Britain’s overall land area – has been sold, mainly to private companies.Local authority and NHS landholdings have been particularly hard hit. Today, local government owns only about 40% as much land as it did four decades ago. The NHS estate has been even more radically depleted, shrinking by around 70%. And the pace of privatisation is accelerating. Both NHS trusts and local authorities are feverishly selling off the few property assets that remain to them as they struggle to make ends meet in the face of swingeing budget cuts imposed by Whitehall.If the sell-off continues, there could be no public land left by mid-century. The NHS and many councils could be landless long before that.Does it matter if the public sector is left without land of its own? Clearly, the government thinks not.The left’s stock response to privatisation has traditionally been to contest or refute the principal logic driving it, which is that assets are utilised more efficiently in private than public hands.But this criticism misses the mark where land privatisation is concerned. Land is different. The biggest problem with land privatisation is not that the private sector is not necessarily a more efficient landowner and user. It is that when land moves from public to private ownership, some socially important land uses simply disappear. Why?",

It is a key document that sets out what is required when leaders meet at the UN climate summit Cop28 in November.The report notes that the 2015 Paris agreement has driven action but says “much more is needed now on all fronts”. Crucially, it says it can be done. “There are now sufficient cost-effective opportunities to address the 2030 emissions gap,” it says.The “indispensable” actions required are “scaling up renewable energy and phasing out all unabated fossil fuels”, as well as ending the destruction of forests and reducing methane emissions, especially from oil and gas operations.The report does not shy away from the scale of the challenge. “It is essential to unlock and redeploy trillions of dollars to meet global investment needs,” it says.

Driving is not inherently antisocial and has been powerfully incentivised for decades, with cheating manufacturers to blame for a false consensus that developed around diesel’s supposedly greener credentials.

A number of food retailers, including Co-op and Morrisons, pulled the 10p bags from their stores in 2021 after learning that most ended up in the bin, with the average household getting through 50 a year.Some more expensive bags are made from a mixture of materials, such as hemp and plastic, which are difficult to recycle.“We can do it better,” Hindmarch, whose designs are favoured by The Princess of Wales and is a friend of Samantha Cameron, said. “There are something like 8bn tonnes of plastic on the planet and that is really shocking when you think about it.",

He has also adopted 60 more as part of an effort to study the effect that grazing has on managing grass, brush and other fuel for wildfires in the face of increasingly extreme blazes.“I started watching the horses and seeing what they were doing,” says Simpson. “They were managing the fuel.”He calls the project the Wild Horse Fire Brigade, and hopes the discoveries he makes from living among the animals will contribute to the debate around the role herbivores can play in wildfire mitigation. Wild horses roam Simpson’s land near the Oregon-California border Simpson socialises with his herd every day and has formed a strong bond with them. The stones (right) mark the spot where he buried one of them, Ariel, on a hilltop near his home Simpson argues that the steep decline of herbivores in the region – the deer population in California has shrunk to less than 500,000 from an estimated peak of about 2m in 1960 – is a factor in the state’s overgrown forests and grasslands, which in turn feeds increasingly extreme wildfires.“We’ve lost our herbivory so now we have abundant, abnormally high levels of vegetative materials – that is what’s driving the fires,” says Simpson. Simpson says a wild horse will consume about 13kg (30lb) of grass and brush a day, which helps keep potential wildfires at bay Federal protection was granted to wild horses and burros in 1971 in an effort to stop their decline.",

London’s example shows what can be done when you combine a clear political will with strong engagement from partners and local communities.”As Labour loses Uxbridge over Ulez, what now for the party’s green policies?Read moreThe Ulez policy, which imposes a £12.50 daily charge on drivers of older diesel and petrol vehicles, was a critical issue in last week’s Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection in north-west London, which Labour narrowly lost.Rishi Sunak has suggested that such wedge issues could be the answer to his party’s electoral problems, while Keir Starmer has indicated Khan should rethink his plans to extend the zone in August beyond inner London to take in all the capital’s boroughs.",

Then, they were asking the festival to call on its sponsor, investment firm Baillie Gifford, to divest from fossil fuels, or otherwise to drop the sponsorship deal. Now, FFB is urging all UK literature festivals and prizes currently receiving sponsorship from Baillie Gifford to join them in calling on the firm to stop fossil fuel investments.“To keep global warming below the critical 1.5°C – and so secure a liveable future – investment in new oil, coal, and gas projects must stop immediately,” the statement reads.“Baillie Gifford currently has up to £5bn invested in the fossil fuel industry, including the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and Petrobras,” it goes on to say. “CNOOC is a shareholder in the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, which is already displacing people from their homes in Uganda and, if it goes ahead, will be the world’s largest heated crude oil pipeline. Petrobras is one of the top 10 companies for projected fossil fuel development and exploration this decade.”Baillie Gifford sponsors a number of literary festivals, including the Hay festival, Cheltenham literature festival and Edinburgh international book festival. It also sponsors the UK’s most prestigious nonfiction award, the Baillie Gifford prize, which announced its 2023 shortlist last week.",

It has the potential to produce 500m barrels of oil and its final approval is expected to reach the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, in the next few weeks. It is expected to be approved after Rishi Sunak hinted last month that it would be “economically illiterate” not to invest in UK oil and gas because Britain will remain reliant on fossil fuels for “the next few decades”.Reducing its potential emissions will play a major part in the approval process for Rosebank, with its main backer vowing to develop the “lowest possible carbon footprint” for the project. The environmental statement drawn up by the project’s backers suggests that they are exploring the option of sourcing clean energy from a forthcoming onshore windfarm in nearby Shetland.“Electrification connected to the electrical grid on Shetland has the greatest potential for [greenhouse gas] reduction with the proposed windfarms on Shetland providing a low carbon source of energy via cable,” it states.The Rosebank field is being developed by the Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor, which is now under pressure from campaigners not to monopolise the energy produced by Shetland’s new 103-turbine Viking windfarm, which is being completed.Construction of a section of the Viking windfarm on Riven Hill near Laxo on Shetland.

After fossil fuels, it is the country’s largest source of national income, and a hugely lucrative one: in 2022, operating profit margins for Norway’s salmon farmers were estimated at 45%.Last September, the Norwegian government set out a proposal to raise taxes on the industry. Aimed at sharing the profits of one the country’s key resources, the idea was widely described as a “salmon tax”, and set at 40% (on top of 22% corporation tax).Within hours, share prices for salmon firms plummeted, with the seafood index on the Oslo Stock Exchange dropping by 25%. Last week, however, the government proposed to press forward regardless, albeit lowering the provisional tax to 35%.The finance ministry has insisted that the controversial levy is designed to ensure that coastal communities receive more of the “value created by fish farming”.

Now that we’re getting rid of many or all of the tailpipe emissions, I think we need to start looking at these quite seriously.”Recent studies have raised concerns about the danger to health from tiny particles produced by tyre wear, as well as from road surfaces and marking, which are now notably greater than those coming from exhausts.Whitty, who explained to the committee how pollution was linked not just to respiratory problems but also heart disease, strokes and even dementia, said indoor pollution was a significant problem, if one less well understood.",

The world has to slash carbon emissions by almost half in the next seven years to remain on track for just 1.5C of global heating and avoid the worst of climate impacts. Yet emissions are rising.However, tucked away in the recent (and devastating) landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a chart that provides the road map for an escape from catastrophe. It assesses with extraordinary clarity the potential for emissions cuts of more than 40 options. You can view it here.The simplicity of the chart is deceptive. It was compiled by a team of the world’s best scientists, based on 175 studies. Its power is amplified by the fact that it was signed off by all of the world’s governments, from the cleanest and greenest to the darkest petrostates.So what does it show? First, solar and wind power are by far the best option, with the potential to cut a staggering 8bn tonnes from annual CO2 emissions by 2030. That is equivalent to the combined emissions of the US and European Union today. Even more startling is that most of that potential can be achieved at lower cost than just continuing with today’s electricity systems.“What struck me especially was that wind and solar was so big,” Prof Kornelis Blok, at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, told me this week. Blok, who led the work on the chart, identified the winners: “The big five are wind, solar, energy efficiency, stopping deforestation and reducing methane emissions.”Just as important as the winners in this analysis are the losers.",

Chantell and Michael Sackett had objected when federal officials required them to get a permit before filling part of the property with rocks and soil.The ruling was the second decision in as many years in which a conservative majority on the high court narrowed the reach of environmental regulations.“While I am disappointed by the supreme court’s decision in the Sackett case, EPA and army [corps of engineers] have an obligation to apply this decision alongside our state co-regulators,” Regan said in a statement on Tuesday.The rule announced on Tuesday revises a rule finalized earlier this year regulating “waters of the United States”. Developers and agriculture groups have long sought to limit the federal government’s power to use the Clean Water Act to regulate waterways, arguing the law should cover fewer types of rivers, streams and wetlands.",

A further 52,000 deaths came from excessive levels of nitrogen dioxide and 22,000 deaths from short-term exposure to excessive levels of ozone.“The figures released today by the EEA remind us that air pollution is still the number one environmental health problem in the EU,” said Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU’s environment commissioner.Doctors say air pollution is one of the biggest killers in the world but death tolls will drop quickly if countries clean up their economies.

No river in England passes tests for chemical or biological pollution, and government targets to improve the water quality in rivers will not be met.“Improvements to wastewater plants should be implemented along with more regulations.

While runoff from farmland has negative impacts on river water quality, the research reveals that sewage discharge into rivers has a greater impact on water quality and the animals and plants that live in rivers.The findings were published in the journals Global Change Biology and Ecological Solutions and Evidence.Albini said: “Our study highlights the disproportionate impact that sewage discharge has on river quality, presenting an urgent need for a comprehensive action plan targeting the sewage discharge problem.",

But “equality” may now be in sight. For decades, those wishing to ride horses on some of the country’s most beautiful off-road routes have had to seek a permit, a bit of paperwork that neither pedestrians nor cyclists need.Forestry England, which oversees that system, maintains that such paid-for permits are important in sensitive sites to avoid damage to the environment or clashes between horse riders and those enjoying a ramble or bike ride through the countryside.The word in equestrian circles in recent days, however, is that despite some suspected reverse snobbery over the perceived high-born status of riders, the “discrimination” of the past may now be coming to an end.A new consultation on the system of permits launched by the forestry agency in recent days and ending on 9 April has given some hope of a more equitable future to Mark Weston, director for access at the British Horse Society (BHS), and the 3 million riders he represents at the charity.“Horse riders should have free access as walkers and cyclists have free access,” he said. “It is discrimination.”“In a lot of forests there aren’t permits at all, which just demonstrates to us that they are not really needed,” he added. “Forestry England’s justification is that the cost of the permits is reinvested into the routes but our view is that it doesn’t really happen and if it does happen, well, walkers and cyclists are benefiting from that investment at the cost of equestrians.”The BHS argues that there is a strong safety argument for better access: in 2022 alone, 68 horses were killed on Britain’s roads and 139 people were injured.Nevertheless, the way forward could be heavy going.",

It is wonderful to see these beautiful flowers return to Stonehenge after 180 years.”To highlight and recreate the spectacle of the Stonehenge dahlia shows, floral sculptures, including a giant trilithon, have been fashioned by local growers, flower arranging clubs and professional florists within a meadow of blooms at the site’s replica neolithic village.Preparations for the Stonehenge dahlia show.

There are, for instance, nearly 10,000 bird species worldwide. In his new book, naturalist Stephen Moss wisely chooses just 10, but in doing so tells the story of the long relationship between birds and humanity – and it has mostly been a disastrous one.Egrets, for instance, were hunted almost to extinction for their snow-white feathers, or aigrettes, which became the accessory of choice for wealthy women. During the first three months of 1885, 750,000 skins of little and snowy egrets were auctioned in London. In China, Mao Tse-Tung ordered the mass extermination of sparrows as part of a campaign against the Four Pests (the other targets were rats, flies and mosquitos). Some 1bn birds were slaughtered – one boy became a national hero for single-handedly strangling 20,000 sparrows with his bare hands. This led to their near extinction and contributed indirectly to the Great Famine that killed between 15 and 55 million people, since the sparrows were no longer available to prey on the insects that ruined crops.Egrets were not the only species that earned human beings huge profits.",

Indeed, the European native oyster was so plentiful in Scotland that 30 million a year were harvested from oyster beds outside Edinburgh in the 1800s.But today the species is almost extinct: populations have dropped by 85% over the past century, most likely because of overfishing from bottom trawling.A new rewilding project part-funded by the Glenmorangie distillery plans to use native oysters a water filters, which would prevent the quality of the company’s whisky from deteriorating, but also mitigate the effects of the organic waste released into the waters of Dornoch Firth. In addition, researchers say the process could increase biodiversity in the area by 50% by the end of the decade.Prof Bill Sanderson, of Heriot-Watt University, diving in Loch Ryan. Photograph: Richard ShucksmithThe scheme would reintroduce 4 million oysters to the Dornoch Firth, on the north-east coast of Scotland, by 2030. As well as helping other species, it could treble the amount of carbon going into the seabed, say scientists working on the project in a new peer-reviewed paper.The Dornoch Environmental Enhancement Project (Deep) is a partnership between Edinburgh’s Heriot-Watt University, the Glenmorangie distillery and the Marine Conservation Society. To predict its potential impact, Heriot-Watt researchers studied Scotland’s last remaining oyster fishery, in Loch Ryan, near Stranraer.The fishery, which has operated since 1701, is unusual in that it uses a rotational harvest system. Different areas are fished, left to repopulate for six years, then fished again, allowing recovery.",

It adds to growing evidence of blurred lines between the UAE’s Cop28 team and its fossil fuel industry.In January, Adnoc’s chief executive, Sultan Al Jaber, who also serves as the UAE’s climate change special envoy, was announced as Cop28 president, which is being hosted in Dubai in November and December. Since then, multiple reports have raised concerns about ties between his two teams. The Cop28 team previously stated that there were “clear governance guidelines in place to ensure the team can operate entirely independently from any other entity”.“It is wholly inappropriate for Adnoc staff to be doing PR for Cop28,” said Pascoe Sabido, a researcher from Corporate Observatory Europe who co-coordinates the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition. He says the findings clearly demonstrate the close links between the oil company and the summit team.Earlier this year, CCR and the Guardian revealed that several members of Adnoc staff had taken up important roles at the summit, including as climate negotiators. Some had even been seconded from ongoing roles with the oil company.In June, the Guardian reported that Adnoc and Cop28 shared an IT system and that Adnoc staff were able to read emails sent to and from the Cop28 team. Adnoc had also been consulted on how to respond to a media inquiry about the summit. At the time, the Cop28 team insisted that the emails were held on a “standalone, firewall-protected network”.",

When we see these levels of decline we need to be thinking about conservation actions.“First of all making sure these birds have habitat to live in – not removing any more – and removing predator species, particularly cats and foxes.”Since 2000 terrestrial bird species showed the greatest declines (62.5%), followed by migratory shorebirds (42.",

This eclipsed the other major fish kill in January 2019, which occurred after months of drought and a wave of high temperatures.Durrant-Whyte has warned that without “substantive change to our regulatory approach … there will be further environmental degradation and recurrence of such events”.Ceremony held in Menindee to release offspring of native fish rescued from 2019 Darling-Baaka mass killRead more“Difficult decisions will need to be made. These are essentially social and not scientific in nature,” he said.A NSW Fisheries survey in May found no mature native Murray cod in about 300km of the lower Darling-Baaka. While most of the fish that died in the March fish kills were bony herring, which breed rapidly in flood conditions, the impact on native species was devastating.The chief scientist’s report, which investigated the causes of the March fish kills, points to changes to flows in the river, the lack of fish passage ladders, which would have allowed fish to move upstream into the lakes and “altered water use in the Northern Basin” as likely key factors in decreasing water quality and the decline of native species.This is a reference to irrigators and the rules around when they can extract water from rivers, as well as the increasing practice of harvesting rainfall and flood events under what is known as flood plain harvesting.",

But even if they do, onshore wind developers warn that the changes are unlikely to be sufficiently wide-ranging to kickstart significant new generation.A Downing Street spokesperson said on Monday: “We support the development of onshore wind where there is local support. Applications will continue to be decided at a local level.”Developers say the changes would still leave an effective ban in place, while Labour’s Ed Miliband promised to give onshore wind parity with other infrastructure projects.Under the current system, a local authority in England can reject an application to build an onshore windfarm on the basis of a single objection from a local resident. Any new development must also have been included in the authority’s most recent local development plan, a document that covers several years’ worth of building schemes.These requirements, which are not applied to other energy sources, were put in place in 2015 by David Cameron under pressure from many of his own MPs, who did not support the widespread development of onshore wind.",

It can affect people of any age in any country and is already killing 1.3 million people a year, according to estimates.chartThe main drivers are still the misuse and overuse of antibiotics, which are used to treat infections. But the study suggests the problem is being worsened by rising levels of air pollution.The study did not look at the science of why the two might be linked. Evidence suggests that particulate matter PM2.5 can contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes, which may be transferred between environments and inhaled directly by humans, the authors said.Air pollution is already the single largest environmental risk to public health. Long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with chronic conditions such as heart disease, asthma and lung cancer, reducing life expectancy.Short-term exposure to high pollution levels can cause coughing, wheezing and asthma attacks, and is leading to increased hospital and GP attendances worldwide.",

Instead, he came across a cluster of spiny objects stuck together in neat geometric clusters.They were unlike anything he’d seen before. “The cells were quite big, they formed quite a large colony that has this amazing geometry,” he says.

They said the only way to protect water supplies was by redistributing water resources more equally.The study used Cape Town in South Africa as a case study and found the richest people used 50 times more water than the poorest. When the Day Zero water crisis struck the city in 2018, after several years of drought, the poorest were left without enough water for their basic needs, the scientists said.Cape Town was far from unique, the researchers said, with similar problems in many cities around the world. Since 2000, more than 80 big cities had experienced extreme drought and water shortages, they said, including Miami, Melbourne, London, Barcelona, São Paulo, Beijing, Bengaluru and Harare.The researchers said urban water crises were expected to become more frequent, with more than 1 billion city dwellers expected to experience water shortages in the near future. In March, a report by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water concluded that the world faces an imminent water crisis, with demand expected to outstrip supply by 40% by 2030.",

She has travelled all over India on birding trips and has, she says, spotted 1,060 of the 1,400 bird species in the country.But it was at home, during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, that she saw an Indian silverbill caught in the protective netting on her balcony, attracting the attention of her cat. Although the bird escaped, some of its feathers were damaged. When Munshi saw the exquisite markings and patterns, she tried to identify the bird, but was struck by how little information there was online.“Though India is rich in bird life, there is very little data on bird species and their feathers,” she says. “There are collections of birds from before 1970, but after the passing of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, ‘round skin’ specimens [the traditional method of preserving dead birds] are not allowed, even for scientific research. Those that are in museums, once the wings are folded and dried up, you cannot see the details of individual feathers.” Feathers from a red-necked falcon In November 2021, Munshi teamed up with Sherwin Everett, a vet and curator at an avian hospital in Ahmedabad, to launch the Feather Library website recording the details and images of bird feathers. The hospital treats about 2,000 birds a month. Many have been injured in road accidents and collisions, or during kite festivals, when they get caught in the kite strings.

Populations of bees, spiders, ground beetles and hoverflies have disappeared twice as fast in areas intensely farmed for crops, according to the paper, which looked at citizen science data on more than 1,500 invertebrate species.Although there was a push to intensify agriculture after the second world war, since the early 90s more sustainable and wildlife-friendly farming practices have emerged, with EU agri-environment funding made available for farmers to plant hedgerows and wild flowers, alongside better regulation of pesticides. However, these have not managed to stem biodiversity loss.“In fact, for most of the taxonomic groups included in this study, declines appear to have accelerated over recent years,” the researchers write in the paper Invertebrate Biodiversity Continues to Decline in Cropland, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.The study suggests that, despite having impact locally, wildlife-friendly farming measures have not been employed on a big enough scale to have an impact nationally. However, the scientists believe that post-Brexit changes to UK agricultural policy could help farming to achieve those goals.Lead researcher Francesca Mancini, from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: “The main message to policymakers is that despite the efforts we have put in in the last 30 years, this is just not enough.

Scavengers and predatory birds are poisoned by eating lead shot in their prey. Birds that have ingested lead are often weakened due to the release of dangerous toxins and are more likely to be targeted by predators, which in turn spreads the contamination through the ecosystem.“It’s such a huge milestone,” said Dr Julia Newth, from the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT). “Lead shot has been contaminating wetlands for more than a century; finally, this law is coming into force.

That is equivalent to 7% of global GDP and almost double what the world spends on education. Countries have pledged to phase out subsidies for years to ensure the price of fossil fuels reflects their true environmental costs, but have achieved little to date.Explicit subsidies, which cut the price of fuels for consumers, doubled in 2022 as countries responded to the higher energy prices resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Rich households benefited far more from these than poor ones, the IMF said. Implicit subsidies, which represent the “enormous” costs of the damage caused by fossil fuels through climate change and air pollution, made up 80% of the total.Ending the subsidies should be the centrepiece of climate action, the IMF said, and would put the world on track to restrict global heating to below 2C, as well as preventing 1.6 million air pollution deaths a year and increasing government revenues by trillions of dollars. The researchers acknowledged that subsidy reform was politically difficult, but said carefully designed policies that supported poorer households could work, especially if coordinated internationally.The IMF’s findings come as the climate crisis wreaks havoc across the world, from heatwaves, wildfires and floods from the Americas to Europe to Asia.Cutting fossil fuel subsidies “needs to be the centrepiece of efforts over the next few years to get on track with limiting global warming to below 2C”, said Ian Parry of the IMF.",

Lead author, Dr Eleanor Tew, head of forest planning at Forestry England and visiting researcher at the University of Cambridge, described the finding as “sobering and alarming”.Many of the threats warned of by researchers are already affecting forests and woodlands. The fungal disease ash dieback will kill up to eight out of 10 of the UK’s ash trees. In 2021, winter storms destroyed about 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres) of forest in Britain. Climate projections show storms, heatwaves, droughts and floods are likely to become more common and more severe.“The problem comes when you get all of those things happening at the same time as multiple, interrelated threats,” said Tew. “That just overwhelms the forest, and you basically get trees dying and the forest ecosystem collapsing … that has massive landscape impacts, and significant impacts for society.”A wildfire on the Clwydian Range moorland in Llangollen, Wales, June 2021.

The larvae of the flies contain proteins and other nutritious compounds so are being raised for animal feed, and they break down waste so are being bred for that, too. However, adult flies are less useful and are discarded after their short life span. Wooley’s team has been trying to use these carcasses to make useful materials from a waste product.",

It was the last place it was possible to wild camp without seeking permission.Darwall, Dartmoor’s sixth-largest landowner, brought the case against the national park authority, arguing that the right to wild camp on the moors never existed. The owner of the 1,619-hectare (4,000-acre) Blachford estate on southern Dartmoor offers pheasant shoots, deerstalking and holiday rentals on his land.On Saturday, hundreds of protesters from the Right to Roam campaign are to march on his land in protest at having their right to wild camp taken away. They are outraged that landowners this week including Darwall have struck a deal with the national park in which they are paid to allow camping on small portions of their land. Campaigners have called it a “stitch-up”.Natural England, the government body in charge of enforcing conservation measures in national parks, has warned the estate not to release pheasants near Dendles Wood, a fragment of temperate rainforest on the southern edge of Dartmoor, adjacent to the Blachford estate. It is protected as a national nature reserve (NNR) and site of special scientific interest (SSSI), and falls within the Dartmoor special area of conservation (SAC). The letter to the estate contained details on the necessary maintenance to retain these statuses, including not releasing pheasants.",

The tube keeps London moving, though often in cramped, uncomfortable and unhygienic conditions.However, Beri believes she has found a way to improve travel for concerned commuters. She has developed a phone app that can direct passengers to routes that offer minimal air pollution.“The UK safe limit for healthy air is to have fewer than 25 small particles in a cubic metre of air,” said Beri. “In some places on the underground, it can top 200 per cubic metre. I want to help people avoid that.”Studies have suggested that long-term exposure to fine particulates could be linked to increased rates of chronic bronchitis and increased mortality from lung cancer and heart disease.Beri, 29, will be given one of Innovate UK’s Young Innovators awards at a ceremony this week for her work on developing the app. She will be among the 94 young entrepreneurs who will receive some £1.25m in grants to help them tackle some of biggest challenges facing society in Britain. Other inventions to be given awards range from cheap alternatives to plastic based on onion skins to a smart medication dispenser that promotes patient independence.Beri’s app suggests routes that provide the lowest risk of breathing air with high pollution levels. “It’s like a TfL [Transport for London] or Google app but instead of offering the speediest journey between destinations it provides routes with the lowest air pollution,” she said.",

MPs from across the political spectrum spoke in favour of the legislation before it passed.The government says the law, which will now move for debate in the Lords, will strengthen the conservation of endangered species and has widespread support from the British public. The ban was part of the 2019 Conservative election manifesto and comes after a high-profile anti-trophy hunting campaign backed by celebrities including Ricky Gervais, Brian May, Ed Sheeran and Joanna Lumley.But many scientists, environmentalists and African community leaders have said the new law could inadvertently accelerate the loss of wildlife, and accused celebrity campaigners of “neocolonialism”. They point to the contributions of regulated trophy hunting to the recovery of populations of black and white rhino in Namibia and South Africa and the snow leopard in Tajikistan.Amid strong views on both sides and accusations of misinformation from pro-hunting groups and anti-trophy hunting campaigners, MPs backed an amendment from Sir Christopher Chope to create an expert advisory board on the import ban. The ban will cover about 6,000 species and include some of the most endangered and charismatic animals, including hippos, leopards and polar bears.British hunters are not a large part of the trophy hunting industry and the ban is considered largely symbolic by conservationists.",

As it grows stronger, scientists fear it will raise the risk in some countries of hunger, drought and malaria.Coupled with hotter global temperatures from burned fossil fuels, the shift could make a host of heat-related dangers worse, from heart disease to suicide.“Heat is unambiguously dangerous,” said Gregory Wellenius, head of the centre for climate and health at Boston university’s school of public health. “Sometimes it leads to hospitalisation, other times it leads to death. Then there’s indirect impacts that follow up on that.”El Niño is the result of natural shifts in winds and ocean temperatures. It brings heavier floods to some parts of the planet while drying others out. The last major El Niño was in 2016, which was the hottest year on record.Because scientists know that weather patterns have changed this year, people and governments can better prepare in the regions affected.“El Niño does not mean more disasters globally than in any other years,” said Walter Baethgen, a scientist at Columbia university’s international research institute for climate and society.",

However, these weather patterns are probably exacerbated by climate breakdown and the heating atmosphere.“The more we burn fossil fuels, the more excess heat will be taken out by the oceans, which means the longer it will take to stabilise them and get them back to where they were,” Burgess told the BBC.This week, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, announced more than 100 new oil and gas licences in the North Sea, against the advice of climate experts.Oceans also regulate the climate, soaking up heat, driving weather patterns, acting as a carbon sink and providing respite as cool air blowing off the sea can make hot land temperatures more bearable.",

It has been welcomed by green groups, clean air campaigners and some businesses, although Conservatives have opposed the charge and said most people in outer boroughs do not want it.Khan said the capital’s toxic air, and the climate emergency, made it a public health imperative, and that revenue raised would go into public transport.New ultra-low emission zone mapAnnouncing the decision at Bonus Pastor school in Lewisham, an area with dangerously poor air quality, Khan said: “The latest evidence shows that air pollution is making us sick from cradle to the grave.

But all of this will be paid for by increased customer bills.The report being withheld from publication predicted the state of the privatised water industry today, and warned against private equity being allowed to move into water firms.It was prepared for the Competition Commission (now the Competition and Markets Authority, CMA) in 2002 and has never been published in full. It should have been released under the 20-year rule last summer, but despite repeated attempts to have it published it is being kept secret.Today, as private equity dominates ownership of the water sector in England, bringing with it high levels of debt and underinvestment leading to sewage pollution, water shortages and leaks, the author of the report has called for full disclosure of his warning two decades ago.Sewage pollution being discharged into rivers was a major issue in the May 2023 English local elections.

This is one that continues to fly beneath the radar and requires serious action from the government at all levels.According to the European Environment Agency, noise pollution is the second largest environmental threat to health, causing 12,000 premature deaths a year. Indeed, at Heathrow, at least 725,000 people are currently exposed to aircraft noise, with that figure expected to more than double should a third runway ever be built.While there is certainly a financial issue with regard to the ability to mitigate the impact of aircraft noise, or indeed move away from it entirely, the fact is that aircraft noise causes health problems for all. Worryingly, many people may not even be aware of it until the damage has been done.The delivery of an airspace modernisation programme over the next few years will see changes to flight paths across the country that will increase the intensity of noise for overflown communities and is likely to expose many communities to aircraft noise for the first time.",

Now, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) has found that most climate denial videos on YouTube push the idea that climate solutions do not work, climate science and the climate movement are unreliable, or that the effects of global heating are beneficial or harmless.Researchers from the CCDH gathered a dataset of text transcripts from 12,058 climate-related YouTube videos posted by 96 channels over almost six years from 1 January 2018 to 30 September 2023. They also included the results of a nationally representative survey conducted by polling company Survation which found 31% of UK respondents aged 13 to 17 agreed with the statement “Climate change and its effects are being purposefully overexaggerated”. This rose to 37% of teenagers categorised as heavy users of social media, meaning they reported using any one platform for more than four hours a day.The report published on Tuesday shows a shift from the “old denial” – that climate change is not happening or not anthropogenic – to the “new denial”.These new denial narratives that question the science and solutions for climate change constituted 35% of all climate denial on YouTube in 2018, but now represent the large majority (70%). Over the same period, the share of old denial has dropped from 65% to 30% of total claims.The report authors believe that this shift is because the scientific evidence is now more accepted and hard to dispute, so those aiming to win people over to climate denial and delay must discredit the solutions and people pushing for climate action.",

Boost the flavours by stirring a glass of dry vermouth or white wine into the soffritto and add aquafaba to give the beans the required texture while also saving waste.Beanotto with radish topsCreamy and satiating, this quick low-waste recipe transforms a few store-cupboard staples and a bunch of radish leaves into an outstanding and potentially climate-friendly weeknight meal.",

If this does not happen, the process will need to begin again.Steve Reed, the shadow environmental secretary, said: “Hunting endangered animals is barbaric and must be confined to history. We must stop the selfish trophy hunters who want to slaughter then display endangered animals’ body parts for their own perverse self-gratification.“The Conservative government must stop siding with these killers. If they refuse to act, they will be complicit in the slaughter as they break yet another pre-election promise.",

Wood and smokeless fuels are being sold in local DIY shops and garages, and once again my neighbourhood is filled with the smell of smoke.A fire may look cosy but it comes with a wider cost. Last year’s chief medical officer’s report recognised that solid fuels are by far the most polluting way to heat a home.A study, by Ricardo Energy and Environment, has estimated that 284 Londoners are now dying early each year due to outdoor air pollution from solid fuel heating. They also estimated about 90 new cases of asthma in children, 60 new cases of stroke and 30 new lung cancer cases each year.This creates annual health and economy cost of £187m, or £24 per Londoner, regardless of whether they burn solid fuels or not. Taking a polluter-should-pay perspective, this is an average burden of almost £800 a year created by each person in London who uses a fireplace or stove.The London study is broadly in line with a European-wide estimate of €760 (£650) yearly societal-health cost for each household that uses a wood stove.Prof Fay Johnston, from the Menzies Institute for Medical Research, Tasmania, who was not involved in the London research said: “Given the high health and economic burden of pollution from this type of heating, interventions to reduce wood heaters in densely populated areas will be highly cost effective. Even small reductions in outdoor wood smoke will reduce the community burden of chronic heart and lung diseases, and increase the average life expectancy of people living in London.",

Britain’s leading garden charity said that although the gastropods were the garden visitor about which they received most complaints, they should be considered an important part of the garden ecosystem.The RHS has been following the method in its own gardens and recently found the nationally scarce wood cricket by the river at Wisley in Surrey. The silver-washed fritillary butterfly, which is of conservation concern, has been discovered on specific plants at Rosemoor in Devon.Golding is inspired by the ecologist Jennifer Owen who for 30 years studied what she found in her urban garden in Leicester, mapping 2,673 different species of flora and fauna, including 474 plants, 80 types of spider and 445 moths.“Definitely take pictures of new and unexpected plants – sometimes known as weeds – in your garden,” Golding said.",

The salamander was named Fukuda-kun in his honour.It was the first time the nesting behaviour of these mysterious amphibians, which it is thought could live up to 100 years and whose biology has changed little over the last 23m years, had been caught on camera.But then, for four years, Fukuda-kun was nowhere to be seen. “He got stuck beneath a dam downstream,” says Fukuda, before the salamander eventually managed to make his way around the barrier.The second largest of the world’s three main giant salamander species (the others are in China and the US), Japanese giant salamanders (Andrias japonicus) can grow up to 1.5 metres in length. The heaviest specimen on record is in Tottori Prefectural Museum and weighs 44.3kg.

Germany missed its targets on cutting consumption of gas under the cold conditions, the German grid agency said.But only a small proportion of last month’s drop in fossil fuel use should be attributed to the weather, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air analysis. The mild temperatures contributed a 6% reduction in gas demand outside the power sector – mostly for heating – while actual demand fell 26%. Within the power sector, milder temperatures can account for two percentage points of the 12% drop in demand, the analysts found.Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst and author of the report, said the data showed that accusations against the EU of falling back on climate commitments were wrong. “There has been a very widespread perception that Europe is going backwards on climate change, because of the Ukraine war,” he said. “There were frequent remarks to that effect at Cop27, saying Europe was going back to coal. We are showing that has not been the case – there was a misreading of coal consumption.”Some member states, including Germany and Poland, have sought a limited return to burning coal for power generation in the face of soaring gas prices and supply constraints in after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier this week, the National Drought Group said England was “one dry spell away” from a repeat of last summer’s dry conditions.Batters said farmers were watching anxiously. “We’ve still got East Anglia, Devon and Cornwall that are in drought,” she said. “We’ve got 63% of rivers below the level that they should be.”“If we’re going to abstract less, we’ve got to store more,” she said, which would mean constructing more reservoirs. “We’ve got to have the ability to store more, that needs to be thought about very urgently. This is a massive issue.”Acute shortages of salad and vegetables in the UK have led to empty shelves, and driven some supermarkets to ration the sale of items such as peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes. Those problems have been mainly caused by unseasonably cold weather and frosts in key exporting regions of Spain and north Africa.The empty shelves have focused attention on the UK’s food security. About 40% of the country’s food is imported, and farmers at the NFU conference in Birmingham earlier this week said this left the UK vulnerable to outside supply shocks.For Batters, food security and the question of water are closely intertwined. There can be none of the former unless the government takes action to secure supplies of the latter, she said.“Water is a massive issue.

For every €1 governments spent building railways, they spent €1.6 building roads.“This is a political choice,” said Lorelei Limousin, a climate campaigner with Greenpeace, which commissioned the report. “We see the consequences today with the climate, but also with people who have been left without an alternative solution to cars.”The report found the EU, Norway, Switzerland and the UK spent €1.5tn (£1.29tn) between 1995 and 2018 to extend their roads – but just €0.93tn (£0.8tn) to extend their rail networks.In the four years that followed (2018-21), the average gap in investment in rail and road decreased from 66% to 34%. During that time, seven countries invested more in rail than roads – Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the UK – while the rest spent more on roads than rail.Dr Giulio Mattioli, a transport researcher at the Technical University of Dortmund, who was not involved in the study, said: “Most European countries have been actually encouraging car use by investing large amounts of public money into expanding motorway infrastructure.”In the public and political debate, Mattioli added, small investments into bike lanes and railways were heavily scrutinised while investments in roads were taken for granted. “This absolutely needs to change if we are to meet climate mitigation targets in the transport sector.”The report found motorways grew most in Ireland, Romania and Poland, and least in Lithuania, Latvia and Belgium.",

You may say it is all in the antlers: I say it is all in the tail. I saw a small herd of fallow deer in London’s Clissold park recently.

Poland, where the average January temperature is around 1C, saw the thermometer climb to 19C on New Year’s Day. At least seven more European countries have seen record highs. Ski resorts closed slopes or resorted to artificial snow.

But of these, the poll said, 53% would be likely to buy one if there was a hypothetical subsidy of £250 on a £1,000 model.",

But unlike his colleagues, he was in a unique position to make his views felt. During her brief premiership, Liz Truss had effectively made him the UK net zero tsar, tasked with writing a comprehensive review of the country’s progress towards achieving the legally binding target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Now Skidmore, one of the co-authors with Truss and the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng of the notorious rightwing Britannia Unchained tract, has delivered a stinging broadside against the government he is leaving.His review argues that the Conservatives have failed on nearly every aspect of net zero policy. Though it is cloaked in polite language, and couched in terms of constructive suggestions rather than hard-hitting new policy demands, there is little in its 320 pages to show the government is on track on any of the wide range of policies needed, on areas from transport to housing, farming to energy generation.“From a former Tory minster, this is a very significant clear-eyed analysis of what is missing from government policy,” said Polly Billington, the chief executive of UK100, a group of local government leaders that campaigns for climate action. “This is a strong critique of the shortcomings on net zero.”Across the areas of policy that are key to meeting emissions target, Skidmore records failure after failure. Renewable energy growth has been hampered by government U-turns and dithering, he notes. Homes are leaking heat because of the government’s refusal to enact insulation programmes, and new ones are still being built with no regard to net zero standards.",

I’ve modified Koffmann’s original, using a smaller quantity of a different meat – in this case venison or lamb steaks – and more vegetables, to keep costs down, to increase the nutritional variety in the dish, and to make it work as a way to use up an open bottle of red wine (the original uses far more than most people would ever have left over).Red wine-braised venisonPierre Koffmann may be a fine-dining chef, but this dish has its origin in French peasant cuisine.

As Earth completed the hottest month ever recorded on its surface, climate experts and engineers made it clear that only global reductions in fossil fuel burning could prevent the planet from entering an era of intense overheating.There have been proposals that still-to-be-developed global technologies could avert impending climate catastrophe and prevent temperatures from soaring. Examples include projects that could capture carbon emissions and store them underground or schemes that could deflect sunlight away from Earth.However, senior researchers say the only realistic hope for avoiding the worst impacts of climate change would be to halt the burning of coal, gas and oil. “The number one priority that we have is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources,” said Dr Greg Mutch of Newcastle University.“That is going to be critical. After you have done that, then you think about capturing any carbon emissions from industrial plants that cannot operate without producing CO2.”Examples of industrial processes that produce carbon dioxide include cement and fertiliser manufacture. These generate carbon dioxide not just by burning fossil fuels for heat but as chemical byproducts from the processes involved in making these products. Industries like these generate about 5% of all carbon dioxide emissions, so it will be worthwhile tackling them, say scientists.However, capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground – as a way to tackle the global problem of climate change – will be far trickier. Although massive amounts of carbon dioxide are emitted every year, it remains a very dilute component of the atmosphere. Around 400 parts per million of air around us is now made up of carbon dioxide. That is 0.04% of the atmosphere.“That is very, very dilute and it will take an awful lot of energy to extract that carbon dioxide.",

The UK has not put reciprocal bans in place, however, meaning damaging species from the continent could be transported in soil.Last week, it was revealed that this year has been the most prolific in England for Asian hornets, which kill native bees. There have been 45 Asian hornets, including 29 nests, seen in the country since the species was first observed in 2016, and this year there have been 22 sightings. This is a large increase since 2022, when only two Asian hornets were seen, and 2021, when there were also two sightings.The Asian hornets first came to Europe in 2004 when they were spotted in France, and it is thought they were accidentally transported in cargo from Asia. They rapidly spread across western Europe and have crossed the Channel to Britain, probably also in cargo.Thirty invasive animal species and 36 invasive plant species of concern have been identified by the government because of their ability to spread across Europe and the UK, and the harm they could cause to the environment.",

Dr Sophie Lund Rasmussen, from the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) at Oxford University, who led the Danish Hedgehog Project that discovered Thorvald, said she was overwhelmed when she discovered how old he was.“I cried tears of joy that I was holding an individual that lived for 16 years. That’s really good news for conservation. Under the right conditions, hedgehogs can live for 16 years – it’s amazing. All my colleagues were laughing at me because they thought I was being so emotional,” she said. The previous record-holder was thought to be a nine-year-old female hedgehog in Ireland, identified by researchers in 2014.Unfortunately Thorvald died at Animal Protection Denmark’s wildlife rehabilitation centre in Silkeborg in 2016 after being set on by a dog, a common cause of hedgehog mortality. Rasmussen says dogs should be kept on leads or locked up at night when hedgehogs are out. “It’s very sad that he lived for so long and then died after being attacked by a dog.”Thorvald was one of almost 700 dead hedgehogs collected by 400 volunteers as part of the citizen science research. They also found a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old, according to the paper, published in the journal Animals.The bodies were sent to researchers who worked out how old they were by counting the growth lines in their jawbones, rather like counting tree rings. This research is significant as hedgehogs numbers are in decline across many European countries, their loss driven by habitat destruction, intensification of agriculture, road traffic incidents and the fragmentation of populations.",

The longer a cell’s telomeres, the more times it can replicate.

That was the period in which the company’s borrowings were increased towards today’s towering level of £14bn and the regulator Ofwat was reduced, more or less, to appealing for Macquarie to get out and make way for more far-sighted owners.Or was Bentley signalling that the hollowing out was worse than feared and now imperils the eight-year plan that was launched in March 2021 to “transform our company from an underperformer”? Have, for instance, the financial assumptions of two years ago been blown apart so that the newish shareholders – who injected £500m as recently as March – now fear they would be throwing good money after bad if they advance the next £1bn slug?In the absence of clear messages from the company, its shareholders or Ofwat, one can only make assumptions about how Thames could have deteriorated so suddenly to a point where the Treasury is panicked. Problem No 1 is well known: the inflationary backdrop, which is plainly an issue when the interest on slightly more than half your debt is linked to the RPI measure.But the less-publicised second problem may be heaping uncertainty upon uncertainty: it is the huge investigation by Ofwat and the Environment Agency to determine whether the industry was not treating as much sewage as it should have been at 2,000-plus treatment plants.

The research suggests that forests may be nearing dangerous temperature thresholds sooner than expected.Using a combination of high-resolution data from Nasa’s thermal imaging instruments on the International Space Station and ground-based experiments in tropical forests across the world, researchers found that a small fraction, approximately 0.01% of all leaves, are already exposed to temperatures beyond their functional limits.Models predict that once we hit a global temperature increase of 3.9 C, these forests might experience mass leaf damage.Warming leaves, even if now in low numbers, act as a “canary in a coalmine for tropical ecosystems”, said Chris Doughty, an associate professor of ecoinformatics at Northern Arizona University and the lead researcher of the study.He said the leaf-warming experiments had revealed a nonlinear rise in temperatures. “We were really surprised that when we warmed leaves by 2, 3 or 4C, the highest leaf temperatures actually increased by 8C. This shows a concerning nonlinear feedback that we were not expecting,” said Doughty.“If we adopt a do-nothing response to climate change and tropical forest air temperatures increase by greater than 4C, there could be massive leaf death, possible tree mortality and species turnover across all tropical forests,” he added.",

It found that the filing of a new case or a court decision against a company reduced its expected value by an average of 0.41%.The stock market responded most strongly in the days after cases against carbon majors, which include the world’s largest energy, utility and materials firms, cutting the relative value of those companies by an average of 0.57% after a case was filed and by 1.5% after an unfavourable judgment.Although modest, the researchers conclude that the drop in the value of big polluters is statistically significant and therefore down to the legal challenges.“We didn’t know before if the markets cared about climate litigation,” said Misato Sato, lead author of the study. “It’s the first evidence supporting what was suspected before; that polluting firms and especially carbon majors now face litigation risk, in addition to transition and physical risk.”Researchers also found share prices fell more in reaction to novel cases involving a new form of legal argument or filed in a new jurisdiction.",

Each had a bone scan three times over a six-year period that was compared with the air they breathed. On average, air pollution accounted for a doubling of the speed of bone loss.In the US, 10 million people are thought to have osteoporosis, of whom about 80% are women. The condition weakens bones and is linked to more than 2m fractures a year in the US, with a cost of more than $20bn (£16.9bn) annually. Only about 40% of these people regain full independence after their fracture. In the UK, osteoporosis affects 3.8 million people and the resulting fractures account for about 2% of total healthcare spending. Small changes in the progress of the disease or the number of resulting bone fractures could therefore have a very large impact on healthcare systems and on the quality of life for many people.The new study helps to explain earlier work by the same research group that looked at hospitalisation for fractures among more than 9 million people in the eastern US. Here the team found that particle pollution increased the number of incidents of people being taken to hospital with fractures by 8% in their study group.Importantly these studies show effects at air pollution concentrations that are well below the current limits in the US and Europe, and well below the UK government’s proposed limits for 2040.Dr Diddier Prada, from the US study team at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, said: “The global population is getting older because of increased life expectancy and declining birth rates.",

Encouraging more traffic will only increase these emissions, and will make the country more unpleasant and polluted to live in.For a start, we already know that building more roads means more traffic – study after study has shown the way in which traffic grows to meet the available space, and five years after any road is built, traffic volume has increased and congestion is as it was originally.We also know it means more air pollution and less land for green spaces and housing.

It was believed he had Sunak’s support, and the government claimed removing these rules for housebuilders could unlock more than 100,000 homes.The nutrient neutrality scheme, aimed at saving England’s rivers from being overloaded with nitrates and phosphates, which cause algal blooms and choke oxygen from rivers, allows developers to pay for “credits” to improve local wetland areas. This allows them to offset pollution caused by new homes that would overwhelm sewage systems in sensitive areas. The proposed new law would have allowed planning officials to ignore the extra pollution caused by sewage from new homes in sensitive areas and runoff from construction sites, with the taxpayer paying for the offsets instead.Previously the government had planned to put the bill, aimed at boosting housebuilding by taking away costs from developers, into the King’s speech. This is no longer planned to be the case.Gove told an event at the Conservative party conference earlier this month that he planned to bring a bill to scrap nutrient neutrality to the House of Commons “as soon as possible provided the prime minister lets me”.Sunak appears to have performed a U-turn, as government sources said ministers would now find alternatives to primary legislation to unblock homes currently in breach of nutrient neutrality rules.",

This means contaminated air can pose a threat to how successfully fruit flies and other insects reproduce, and could lead to population decline.“Everyone knows that we are facing insect decline, and so far the reason was pesticide use and habitat loss. But we think that we should also consider oxygen pollutants,” said Markus Knaden, a researcher of evolutionary neuroethology at the Max Planck Institute and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications.This study builds on research into how insects perceive flower odours differently when exposed to elevated levels of ozone. Knaden’s team tested nine different species of Drosophila fruit flies by exposing half the males from each species to ambient air, and half to an atmosphere with ozone levels at 100 parts per billion. Average industrial ozone levels are at roughly 40 parts per billion, but regions like India, China or Mexico experience magnitudes as high as 210 parts per billion.The scientists found the males exposed to higher ozone levels started emitting fewer pheromones. As a result, they had trouble attracting female partners. “When we expose male flies to ozone, then suddenly it took them much longer to convince the female to mate,” said Knaden.",

Closure of the plant resulted in an immediate reduction in air pollution for the local communities. Sulphur dioxide decreased by 90%, arsenic by 66% and particle pollution also improved.There was an immediate 42% decrease in emergency room visits for heart problems and further declines in the three years that followed, until the end of study, showing that the closure led to long-term health improvements.

These changes were not seen in two communities away from the plant that were used as experimental controls.When looking at medical statistics it is possible to overlook the real-world experience of the people affected. Testimony from the local community reveals what it was like to live with the air pollution, dust and odour from the plant. Some people explained how they struggled to manage their asthma and others said their breathing problems got worse when they first moved into the area.

Elisabeth Stern, 74, who is on the organisation’s board, said it felt like “a historic moment”.During the hearing, the KlimaSeniorinnen’s legal team presented evidence that older adults suffer worse than others during periods of extreme heat and are more likely to die. Older women are even more vulnerable.The British barrister Jessica Simor KC, who is representing the women, told the court her clients were already experiencing the effects of climate change, which posed “extremely serious threats not just to their health and wellbeing but to their very existence”.",

California is also running pilot projects to relocate beavers to places where they can be more beneficial.Catch her if you can: viral surfboard-swiping otter is on the loose, and fans love itRead moreThe aim is to preserve more beavers, along with their nature-friendly behaviors, including creating lush habitats that lure species back into now-urban areas, enhance groundwater supplies and buffer against the threat of wildfires.“There’s been this major paradigm shift throughout the west where people have really transitioned from viewing beavers strictly as a nuisance species, and recognizing them for the ecological benefits that they have,” said Valerie Cook, the beaver restoration program manager for California’s department of fish and wildlife.The push follows similar efforts in other western states including Washington, which has a pilot beaver relocation program, Cook said. It marks a new chapter in Californians’ lengthy history with the animals, which experts say used to be everywhere, but after years of trapping, attempts at reintroduction and then removal, they are found in much smaller numbers than they once were – largely in the Central valley and the northern part of the state.It is unknown how many beavers live in California, but hundreds of permits are sought by landowners each year that typically allow them to kill the animals. The beaver population in North America used to range between 100 million and 200 million but now totals between 10 million and 15 million, according to the state.",

In the case of the water companies, most of them were privatised as sensibly capitalised plcs. As local monopolies, they were regulated by Ofwat with a view to protecting customers from monopolistic pricing behaviour.This approach was carefully thought through by the government on the basis of the business and demographic environment of the time. For some years this worked well in terms of operational efficiency, reliability of water supply and water treatment, and was a good deal for the customer – perhaps too good.However, from about the start of the 21st century, two key issues were allowed to arise – neither of which was addressed by successive governments – that had not been envisaged at the time of privatisation.The first was that these sensibly capitalised plcs were acquired by private equity and infrastructure funds, largely based outside the UK. They used substantial amounts of debt for acquisition, with a view to paying down the debt as rapidly as possible from the strong positive cashflows that these companies generated; this in order to maximise the equity returns. Second, extraordinarily, this policy was aided and abetted by the regulatory regime.This regime disincentivised companies from investing for the long term, in an attempt to minimise water price increases for customers.",

Photograph: Scott Trageser/AlamyResearchers mapped the effects of extreme heat on more than 33,000 land vertebrates by looking at maximum temperature data between 1950 and 2099. They considered five predictions of global climatic models based on different levels of greenhouse gas emission, as well as the distribution of terrestrial vertebrates, to work out how exposed animal populations would be.“A couple of studies have shown recent climate warming trends match the 4.4C scenario much better than the other scenarios,” said lead author Gopal Murali, who was at Ben-Gurion University of Negev, Israel when he carried out the research. “We wanted to highlight the disastrous consequences for wildlife if we end up with a high, unmitigated emission scenario.",

Between 40% and 70% of dormice die during the hibernation period.Ian White, a dormouse officer at PTES, said: “There’s an old Worcestershire saying: ‘Woods don’t grow beneath trees’, and we no longer have this complexity and under-storey in woods because of increased browsing by deer, but also increased shading – we don’t cut our woodlands enough.“It’s a double-whammy. Now winters are becoming more mild and variable, there’s a danger that dormice will wake up and they can only do that so many times before they run out of energy. Wetter springs and summers also stop dormice feeding because their fur is not waterproof [so they don’t go out in rain], and they only produce on average four young per year – they don’t have the breeding potential of mice and rats.",

This has seen Labour aping Jeremy Hunt’s ludicrous emphasis on reducing the national debt. Instead, Labour must become leader of a pack of opposition parties all demanding a massive increase in expenditure on social and green infrastructure, and on the wages and conditions of those working in these areas. One recent estimate suggests that to achieve this, the next government will need to invest £220bn per year.All opposition parties should promise the next parliament will use its powers to provide the money needed to fix broken Britain. This can come from three sources. First, the estimated £55bn a year of tax breaks for pension savers must be redesigned to support employment-creating investment with social and environmental goals, as should some of the £70bn a year saved tax-free in Isas – a much-needed exercise in intergenerational solidarity.Second, increased revenue from a fairer taxation system, where the wealthier contribute far more. Finally, as a backstop for any funding shortfalls, quantitative easing should be restarted. What Labour and indeed all the opposition parties have got to grasp is that you can’t have the necessary equivalent of Roosevelt’s New Deal without a massive increase in new debt.",

So you’ve got the canopy layer of the trees, you’ve got the climbing plants that scramble up the trees and climb on fences. You’ve then got the shrub layer, ground cover layer, you have mushrooms, you have this swale feature which holds water, and then you’ve got roots.“So it’s a kind of multilayer garden with high degrees of biodiversity, intermingled planting, so rather than just having a block of shrubs, it’s got lots of different species growing harmoniously together.”Tom Massey suggests adding about 30 plant species, from poppies to grasses to trees to climbing plants.

Their work began in 2018 after they arrived at the Ximenes settlement, in the municipality of Barreiros in Pernambuco state in north-eastern Brazil. They had been displaced from their homes because of the expansion of the Suape port area farther north.The new settlement provided by the government is surrounded by a huge sugar cane plantation. The soil is unproductive, and pesticides threaten the native bees. There are no paved roads, schools or health centres in the area. Housing is precarious and the area is often flooded by the river.With few options for planting, the women turned to the local university to learn how to keep bees. Prof Renata Valéria Gomes, from the zootechnics department at the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, provided the protective suits and hives and taught them beekeeping techniques to produce quality honey, free of pesticides. Until then beekeeping in the municipality was exclusively undertaken by men.Added to the financial independence they got by selling honey, the women pushed for a new sustainable dynamic in the community. To attract more bees, they began to plant crops around their homes using techniques passed down by their ancestors, transforming their back yards into oases with flowers, trees and crops. They combine genetic improvement techniques with ancestral knowledge to find sustainable ways of producing honey.",

Paintings by Lowry, Constable, Monet and Turner show how our skies were often filled with haze and smoke, but we have few measurements to understand how much pollution was in the air and what it was made of.Dr Ann Power, of the University of Exeter, has been looking for evidence of past air pollution in the mud of urban and agricultural ponds. “We wanted to understand how exposure to urban air pollution has changed over the last 200 years as our towns and cities have evolved since the Industrial Revolution. We focused on the Merseyside region due to its industrial past and present-day high rates of long-term illness,” she said.Investigations of historical air pollution often involve considerable creativity. Previous studies have tracked air pollution through the early 20th century by examining the soot-stained feathers of stuffed birds from museum collections, and others have used 18th-century measurements of the electrical properties of the atmosphere made by amateur weather enthusiasts.In her research, Power paddled a small inflatable boat around ornamental and agricultural ponds in Merseyside. All were present in maps from the 1800s. The largest was less than half the size of a football pitch, and the smallest were less than a few metres across.

The move was rejected by Labor senators on the basis it would duplicate the work of existing agencies.The ACTU, with its 38 affiliated unions and 1.8 million workers, has much greater institutional sway within Labor. The call for an energy transition authority is backed by the mining union and the Electrical Trades Union, both affiliates of the Labor party.According to excerpts of her speech, O’Neil says the authority would “support the workers at fossil fuel facilities that will phase down in the transition to a net zero carbon future”.“That means individualised labour adjustment packages to guarantee workers affected by the transition have access to quality, secure, and safe jobs,” she says.“These should include industrywide pooled redundancy and redeployment schemes, education and training opportunities, income replacement and relocation packages where necessary, and early retirement packages where voluntary and appropriate.",

The first products will be available from the end of August in the UK, EU and US.The price has yet to be set and the company will gather customer feedback from the first batches to tweak the product’s recipe, name and packaging before the full launch. The cost will be higher than regular ribs, which are generally a cheap meat product.Makers of plant-based meat are continuing to innovate, but some big companies in the sector have had a slump in sales as the cost of living crisis pushes shoppers towards cheaper regular meat.Cutting traditional meat consumption in rich nations, where people already eat more red meat than is healthy, is vital to tackling the climate crisis. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are dominated by those from livestock, particularly cattle, which make up 15% of all global emissions.Plants cause far lower emissions. Cutting meat and dairy consumption also slashes pollution, and land and water use, with scientists saying it is the single biggest way for people to reduce their impact on the planet.“To some, bones from plants may be an ideological provocation, but we shouldn’t take these things too seriously,” said Vladimir Mićković, co-founder of Juicy Marbles, which is based in Slovenia. “It’s just fun.

I particularly like it with cheese, especially when the jelly’s spiked with jalapeño.Because of its similarities in appearance at least, some pioneers of the plant-based world have adopted this frugal recipe as an alternative to honey, using a little less pectin to stop the syrup from setting, and to give it a honey-like viscosity.

In total, the birds manage 11 hours of snoozing a day – without ever slipping into uninterrupted sleep.“Humans cannot sustain this state, but penguins can,” said lead researcher Paul-Antoine Libourel from Lyon Neuroscience Research Centre. “Sleep is much more complex in its diversity than what we read about in most textbooks.”Researchers previously looked at penguin sleep in the 1980s, which involved capturing them, putting them in a shelter and watching them. They reported fragmented sleep for short periods of time, which they called “drowsiness”. In the latest research, experts found that this fragmented sleep was sustained for the whole day, showing the penguins are not “nodding off” into deeper sleep.“Sleep in breeding chinstrap penguins was highly fragmented under all conditions and positions on land,” researchers wrote in the paper, published in the journal Science.

He soon became known for his tendency to wander into the road, causing all sorts of commotion.On Facebook and Instagram, people regularly posted photographs and videos of the turkey standing in the middle of a road, preventing cars from passing by fearlessly pecking at tires and flapping his wings. Despite sometimes causing mile-long traffic jams, Turkules was hailed as a sort of West Orange mascot. His popularity was such that on Saturday businesses organized a “Hometown Hero” event in Turkules’s honor.But it turns out that the Hometown Hero celebration, during which businesses donated a portion of profits to the Wildlife Conservation Society, was really a goodbye.On Tuesday, the New Jersey department of environmental protection told the Guardian that after a weeks-long effort, Turkules had been captured and relocated to Wharton state forest, 85 miles away.It has left locals bereft.“I’ll miss him a lot.",

Glyphosate separately has been linked to cancer and other health problems.‘Disturbing’: weedkiller ingredient tied to cancer found in 80% of US urine samplesRead more“If the developing fetus is especially vulnerable to glyphosate, it is critical to understand the magnitude and sources of exposure during this critical developmental period,” the new paper states.The authors include researchers from the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Washington; Boise State University; and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Glyphosate is the world’s most widely used herbicide and is the active ingredient in products sold around the world, including the widely used Roundup brand developed by Monsanto and now owned by Bayer after Bayer’s 2018 acquisition of Monsanto.The results of the study were considered somewhat surprising because none of the women studied worked with glyphosate or other herbicides or had a household member who worked with weedkillers, said Cynthia Curl, associate professor at Boise State and lead author on the paper.“What is going on?

But in the event of a SSW episode, stratospheric temperatures rise rapidly in the space of only a few days, leading to the weakening or even reversal of these winds.

The rule change would also strip the ministry for Indigenous peoples of responsibility for delimiting Indigenous territories, handing those powers to the justice ministry.Silva and Guajajara both denounced the moves, amid anger and alarm that members of Lula’s administration had not done more to oppose the changes, which are likely to be voted on by the lower house and senate in the coming days.“They are fleecing the environment ministry,” Marina Silva told the newspaper O Globo.",

As Britain strives to meet a 2030 target to end the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, that judgment is beginning to look a little complacent.Amid ongoing economic headwinds, data has emerged that suggests a drop-off in current demand for electric cars, despite notable public enthusiasm for their adoption in principle. Auto Trader, which hosts the country’s largest car sales website, reported this month that inquiries in relation to new electric vehicles had fallen significantly compared with last year.A number of factors are likely to be involved. As interest rates and inflation remain high, the upfront cost of a new electric car makes it more expensive in the short term than a petrol or diesel one.

And the problem is likely to get worse unless new, humane measures to curtail animal numbers are developed in the near future, say scientists.It is a critical environmental issue that will be debated this week at a major conference in Italy where experts will discuss how best to limit numbers of grey squirrels, wild boar, deer, feral goats, pigeons, parakeets and other creatures that are causing widespread ecological damage in many countries.A key approach to be highlighted at the meeting will be the need to develop contraceptives for animals. These would provide conservationists and farmers with a means to curtail animal numbers in a humane way, say researchers.Wild boar provide an illustration of the issues involved. Their numbers are rising across Europe, and UK breeding populations have been established in areas such as the Forest of Dean. With their large snouts and muscular necks, boar are good at rooting up fungi and seeds and can destroy crops, vulnerable habitats, ground-nesting animals and fragile root systems. Wild boar have also been linked to the spread of African swine fever to domestic pigs.The 2.7 million population of grey squirrels in the UK are threatening the native red species.

With catastrophic rates of bird flu currently contributing to serious concerns about disease in wildlife, the new report may have important implications for the way such outbreaks are tracked.The area surveyed was a wild expanse on the coast of the Dutch Wadden Sea, where both species of seals “haul out” on the intertidal flats and beaches to rest, socialise, mate and give birth. They gather there in great numbers. Up to 6,500 grey seals choose the high sandbanks, while harbour seals – about 8,000 were observed – prefer sands revealed at low tide.Unfortunately, the large numbers of harbour seals have faced disastrous outbreaks of disease in the past. Phocine (seal) distemper virus ravaged the populations in 1988 and 2002, halving numbers. About 18,000 harbour seals died of distemper in the UK and Europe in the 1988 outbreak.

The study, from the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), based on extensive interviews with consumers, found widespread misunderstandings around common terms such as “biodegradable”, “compostable” and “recyclable”, leaving participants angry when they discovered what they meant.According to the ASA, households in the UK take pride in recycling and food-waste management, and hope to play their part in preventing the destruction of nature by putting rubbish into correct bins or buying products with green packaging.However, some participants in the new research believed the labelling meant that packaging would disappear entirely or decompose. Some of those surveyed were surprised to learn that “biodegradable” packaging has an unlimited timeframe to break down and could produce toxins.Many “compostable” products need to be taken to a specialist waste centre and would not break down in a household compost bin, although many of those surveyed believed the products could be composted at home.‘It’s greenwash’: most home compostable plastics don’t work, says studyRead moreMiles Lockwood, director of complaints and investigations at the ASA, said the regulator would be cracking down on the use of the terms in adverts as part of its action on greenwashing.“Consumers were telling us that they were proud of what they were doing on the environment. They have green bins, they were separating things out, they were doing their bit for the environment and it made them feel good.“When we began to explain the differences between recycling in the home or recycling in a centre, it created a sense of depression or disappointment at what is happening,” said Lockwood.",

The figures show how privatisation – which was intended to lead to a new era of investment, improved water quality and low bills – turned water into a cash cow for investment firms and private equity companies, none more so than the Australian infrastructure asset management firm Macquarie which, with its co-investors, bought Thames Water in 2006 from the German utility firm RWE for £4.8bn.",

The trouble is, this fuel is obtained by splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen with electricity generated by renewable sources. Tunisia has lots of sun but precious little fresh water.The only way of producing the raw material needed for green hydrogen is sucking up Mediterranean water and desalinating it. But a report last year for the Heinrich Böll Foundation, affiliated to Germany’s green political movement, warns that this would be a dirty, energy-intensive, water-guzzling process – and put the high cost of decarbonising the rich world on to the shoulders of poorer nations.Many sun-drenched countries, especially in the Maghreb, have been sold a future as export hubs for green hydrogen. The pitch is seductive. As 1kg of hydrogen contains about three times as much energy as 1kg of petrol, it is no wonder that hydrogen is being touted as a fuel of the future. Europe’s green deal, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by the end of the decade, relies on green hydrogen production in north Africa and Ukraine.Producing green hydrogen in Europe is not impossible.

Our health would be improved by further reducing air pollution, even when it met current standards.

Federal rules require government agencies to respond to petitions “within a reasonable time”.“Given the magnitude of the health and environmental threats, competing priorities do not justify further delay,” the lawsuit argues.Livestock and poultry create about 1.4bn tons of manure a year, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Factory farms often store manure in ponds that can overflow into streams, lakes or rivers and leach into groundwater.Manure causes nitrogen and phosphorus in water, tainting drinking water and causing toxic algal blooms that can be deadly to aquatic life. Waste-polluted water can irritate skin and cause gastrointestinal and respiratory problems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The agency itself has said that three-quarters of factory farms discharge pollution, said Emily Miller, an attorney for advocacy group Food & Water Watch, the lead petitioner. But EPA has essentially let companies decide whether they want to comply with the Clean Water Act, she said.“EPA has set up a catch-me-if-you-can system,” Miller said.

Already, in Australia, politicians and scientists have renewed their criticism of public entities using international carbon credit schemes to offset local emissions. Verra, the Washington-based non-profit at the centre of the story, is the world’s leading carbon standard, certifying the credits that companies use to make claims about their environmental impact. It is a blow to anyone committed to the idea that emissions trading can help the world to reach net zero, to learn that 90% of the rainforest credits analysed are unlikely to represent genuine carbon reductions.The problem, which was uncovered by journalists working alongside experts using satellite images, is the methodology used by Verra to certify its credits. While Verra disputes the findings, and is due to publish its own assessment, the researchers found that the evidence used to calculate offsets was flawed. Predictions of what would have happened in the absence of credits were unreliable, and benefits were overstated.Given Verra’s importance, the significance of the findings goes beyond a single organisation. What happens next is crucial, and will be closely watched by governments and businesses around the world. The question is: can existing processes be improved?

The clans might meet but they never interbred, he added. Their sense of identity appeared, in human terms, almost tribal, recognising and maintaining their differences while being of the same species.Sperm whales have the biggest brains on the planet. The animals can reach 15 metres in length, weigh up to 45 tonnes, and are able to dive for up to two hours in search of food, mostly squid. They are present in oceans around the world.Whitehead noted that the clans appeared to be “almost entirely female-based”. Males visited females occasionally and for only a few hours at a time. Their “only important transfer is of sperm”. Designated females undertook “alloparental” care, looking out for calves while their mothers dived for food.While underlining how different whales were from humans, the paper suggested intriguing correspondences.

More than 100 spent time in jail, either convicted or on remand, for environmental protest in 2022.“We stand with all those who are trying to sound the alarm and to protect our beautiful world,” said the letter, coordinated and published by the group Writers Rebel.Invoking the urgency of the crises affecting the world’s climate and ecosystems, it continues: “Right now, many people who are deeply concerned about the climate and environment are turning to civil disobedience.“While it is understandable that the state wishes to limit the disruption this may cause, it is vital that the right to protest is protected. Protest plays an essential part in our society in raising public awareness and enabling change.”In 2022, parliament passed a host of anti-protest laws written specifically to tackle climate protesters, and more are proposed in a public order bill being considered by MPs.Among the new laws was a statutory offence of causing a public nuisance, which was used to convict Jan Goodey, a university lecturer from Brighton, after he climbed a gantry over the M25 to stop traffic. He is serving a six-month sentence.Also behind bars are Abigail Percy-Ratcliff, Alexander Wilcox, Callum Goode, Daniel Shaw, Ian Bates, Karen Matthews, Louis McKechnie, Marcus Decker, Morgan Trowland, Paul Bleach, Roger Hallam and Samuel Price, according to a list provided by Just Stop Oil.Many are on remand for long periods.",

The WHO completed a review of its 2005 guideline air quality levels in September 2021, halving its limit for PM2.5 to five micrograms.Air pollution has long been implicated in a number of respiratory disorders but, the researchers noted, a growing body of evidence is establishing a link with mental health disorders. So far, however, the only available studies on the risk of depression were carried out in regions with air pollution concentrations exceeding UK air quality limits.",

By most accounts, the sprawling tree was the heart of the oceanside community – towering more than 60ft (18 meters) and anchored by multiple trunks that span nearly an acre. This year the town celebrated the banyan’s 150th birthday with cake.Today, the tree is still standing but the fire that burned through the area left it charred.“It certainly doesn’t look like that tree is going to recover,” James B Friday, an extension forester with the University of Hawaii, told the New York Times after reviewing photos and videos of the damage. The tree’s thin bark would not have provided adequate protection from the flames, he said.The colossal tree has shaded community events, including art fairs, for 150 years.“It’s kind of the center of town,” Amy Fuqua, a Maui resident, told the Associated Press in a 2016 interview when she was the manager of the Lahaina visitors’ center. “Everyone knows where it’s at.

Twenty were popular sites for bathing, and 20 were upstream of a nearby sewage overflow associated with those swimming spots. Using Environment Agency methodology, 24 of the 40 locations would be deemed “poor” quality, and four of 20 bathing sites showed a clear decrease in water quality from locations upstream to downstream of a sewage overflow.England to diverge from EU water monitoring standardsRead moreThe report highlights that this year across the UK, untreated sewage was discharged more than 399,864 times into waterways – the equivalent of more than 1,000 discharge events every day. Surfers Against Sewage also reported 1,924 cases of sickness due to suspected sewage pollution in the UK over the last year – nearly triple the number of cases reported in the previous year. The cases resulted in 1,987 days taken off sick.The case of Reuben Santer, a physics teacher at a secondary school in Exeter, is highlighted in the report.

A second site, at Inner Silver Pit South, would not be designated as the high cost to fishers would not be offset by the designation, the government said.The remaining three sites, at Allonby Bay in Cumbria, Dolphin Head in the eastern Channel and north-east of Farnes Deep, in the North Sea, will be created before 6 July this year, enabling nature to recover by banning harmful activities, including fishing, construction and dredging. They were chosen because of the ecological importance of nature recovery in the sites, the government said.",

I feel blessed that she said yes and her team is donating their work and all proceeds to this battle.”There was an “elegant resonance” to the fact that her voice was the same age as Rosalía’s on the recording, said the singer, who will be 58 on Tuesday.

Farming groups have also criticised its close relationship with supermarkets, when farmers have felt ripped off by rising prices not being passed down the supply chain to their struggling businesses.The Labour Defra team is getting ready to release its strategy for governing if the party wins the election next year. Shadow ministers say they would take on big businesses by handing out criminal sanctions to chief executives who run polluting companies, and fixing the supply chain so farmers are paid a fair price for food sold in supermarkets.Labour sources said fighting for justice for neglected rural communities, who have had their local areas polluted, and been ripped off by big businesses such as supermarkets, was a key part of their election campaign. Winning rural and coastal seats is likely to prove crucial to the party’s chances of commanding a majority.",

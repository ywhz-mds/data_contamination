However, demand for treated mains water, which takes time to process and deliver, was greater than we could meet,” he said.",

At between 200 metres and 1,000 metres below the surface, the twilight zone is home to a variety of organisms and animals, including specially adapted fish such as lantern sharks and kitefin sharks, which have huge eyes and glowing, bioluminescent skin.“Penicillin is an antibiotic that originally came from a fungus called Penicillium so we might find something like that from these ocean fungi,” said Fabio Favoretto, a postdoctoral scholar at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. The twilight zone is characterised by high pressure, a lack of light and cold temperatures, which presents an extreme environment “where fungi might exhibit unique adaptations”, he added. “That could potentially lead to the discovery of new species with unique biochemical properties.",

His major scientific contribution concerned his work on octopuses, in which he was engaged for most of his life.Andrew’s study into why cephalopods change colour in complex patterns demonstrated that it was not just about camouflage but ways of communicating and expressing feelings.He was very critical of what he called the genetic determinists, who somehow “missed the magic” of nature. He understood the theory of evolution as being about organisms as a whole and not just genes, and he argued that contemporary evolutionary theory, which is focused on genes, fails to take into account feelings (affect) and the role of altruism that can only be observed at the level of interactions between organisms within species. This alternative understanding of evolution, he suggested, was much more in line with Darwin’s original ideas.Andrew was born in Sedbergh, Cumbria, to Katharine (nee Johnston), a nurse, and Eric, a teacher who later became a vicar.",

The increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, as part of the country’s green ambitions, also means there can be rapid shifts in the main source of electricity generation. On windy days, most electricity generation comes from onshore and offshore windfarms. When conditions are cold and still, gas-fired power stations known as peaking plants are called into action.The electricity system in Great Britain relies on a combination of “baseload” power – from stable generators such as nuclear and biomass plants – and “intermittent” sources, such as wind and solar farms that need the right weather conditions to feed energy into the grid. National Grid also imports energy from overseas, through subsea cables known as interconnectors that link to France, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. They allow companies to trade excess power, such as renewable energy created by the sun, wind and water, between different countries.",

He has rescued even the most vulnerable, difficult creatures, such as Grévy’s zebra, which is a highly endangered species.Lekupania works in Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy in the far north of Kenya. The giraffe is an orphaned baby “reticulated giraffe” named Fupi, which means Shorty in Swahili. Fupi was injured when he fell into a ditch. He was rehabilitated and returned to the wild. And now all the rehabilitated giraffes come every morning to check on Lekupania. They do a round of the stables and greet him, then make their way back to the wild.This photo was taken in 2016, during a period of drought. Giraffes today are slowly and silently becoming extinct. Sometimes that’s due to poaching, but in this part of Kenya it’s mostly drought-related and from habitat loss.",

Transport policy unites two big themes of environmental politics: the idea that many people need to be reconnected with local geographies, both physical and human; and opposition to pollution.

The London conurbation, for example, includes chains of lakes, many of which are suitable for swimming, as well as former docks and stretches of the Thames and other rivers that between them could provide far more swimming opportunities than open air pools ever have.The main barrier in the case of the rivers is the dumping of sewage, which may require investment to fix – but that investment is essential for other environmental reasons anyway.

Exposure to these tiny particles dominates the health harm from air pollution and is the leading environment risk factor for early death. PM2.5 comes from the burning of solid and liquid fuels, through power generation, domestic heating and motor traffic. It can also form in the air from chemical reactions between other pollutants.A growing body of research shows that these particulates are responsible for a huge range of health problems from lung and heart disease to diabetes and cancer, brain function to premature births. As well as leaving millions of people with life-limiting chronic health conditions, they also lead to the early death of more than 400,000 people across Europe each year. Experts say more than 200,000 of these could be saved if the air in Europe met World Health Organization guidelines.The current WHO guidelines state that annual average concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms a cubic metre (µg/m3).Gary FullerWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.",

It’s that simple. If the government disagrees, it needs to provide evidence and prove it in court.”The field was given the green light in September and has the potential to produce 500m barrels of oil in its lifetime, which when burned would emit as much carbon dioxide as running 56 coal-fired power stations for a year.",

This was because when the new varieties failed, because of drought or disease, they did so more spectacularly than traditional varieties, and thus increased the risk of hunger and destitution.

At the Labour conference, the question has been: is the party up to the fight?Keir Starmer is attempting to counter Rishi Sunak’s doom and gloom about the supposed cost of climate action with a more optimistic message. He unveiled some long-awaited green policies, including a proposal for community renewable energy. The Labour leader also referenced the climate catastrophes that have swept the world this year, and reminded the audience “clean British energy is cheaper than foreign fossil fuels”.He also reiterated his commitment to keeping Britain’s net zero targets, saying: “When Rishi Sunak says roll back on our climate mission, I say speed ahead.”Starmer also promised more green spaces and pointed out it was under a Labour government that the first national park was designated.Some had feared the party would join a race to the bottom, trying to match Sunak’s vandalism of environmental policies.",

It then increased to 1.6% in 2021, but remained below the level seen almost a decade earlier..The report highlighted cuts to government support for green projects under Cameron, who was reported to have told aides in November 2013 to “get rid of all the green crap” from energy bills.At the time, his team said they did not recognise the phrase, but did not issue an explicit denial, and it came to symbolise the sea change from his previous claim to be leading “the greenest government ever”.",

They are designed as one unit so batteries cannot be separated from the plastic.The organisation said the lithium batteries inside the plastic can sharply increase in temperature if crushed and can become flammable. This costs taxpayers money through fire damage to equipment and the specialist treatment needed to deal with hazardous waste.Last year, research by Material Focus – a non-profit organisation which runs the Recycle Your Electricals campaign – found that about 1.3m single-use vapes are thrown away each week in the UK – an extraordinary rise since the first was sold in 2019.

It makes up 60% of our cartilage and accounts for 70 to 80% of the dry weight of skin, also featuring in other connective tissues such as tendons, muscles and bones.It gives our bodies elasticity and resilience, but its production slows down as we age, leading to more aches and pains and making us look older and more wrinkly.

After fossil fuels, it is the country’s largest source of national income, and a hugely lucrative one: in 2022, operating profit margins for Norway’s salmon farmers were estimated at 45%.Last September, the Norwegian government set out a proposal to raise taxes on the industry. Aimed at sharing the profits of one the country’s key resources, the idea was widely described as a “salmon tax”, and set at 40% (on top of 22% corporation tax).Within hours, share prices for salmon firms plummeted, with the seafood index on the Oslo Stock Exchange dropping by 25%. Last week, however, the government proposed to press forward regardless, albeit lowering the provisional tax to 35%.The finance ministry has insisted that the controversial levy is designed to ensure that coastal communities receive more of the “value created by fish farming”. Host municipalities will receive more for “schools, elderly care and other welfare services”, it said.The tax extends the principle behind Norway’s pension fund.",

From my experience as a member of and advocate for minority communities in the UK, it has become increasingly evident that time in the natural world is far less accessible to some of us than we would hope.I’ve been adventuring in the outdoors for nearly 20 years now, and from the very beginning I noticed that I wouldn’t bump into people like myself in rural spaces, despite my city being very diverse.One might think that nature, being free, is available to all. But free isn’t enough when we consider the barriers faced by minority communities. Geographical limitations are often the first hurdle: most minority communities are based in urban areas, making it an endeavour both in terms of time and resources to travel to rural areas. A recent study showed the whitest areas of the country enjoy an astounding 144% more local footpaths than the most ethnically diverse.When the pandemic hit, I sensed there was an opportunity to start improving the diversity in our rural spaces, while tackling loneliness and connecting communities at the same time.",

I’ve been an urban gardener for seven years, growing my own food in an 8x5m space in London. It all began for me as a tribute to my grandfather, who taught me everything I know about gardening and the living soil around us: how to use every part of the fruit and vegetables I grow; the importance of micro-organisms; using organic practices to nurture plants and protect Mother Earth.Now, I’m on a mission to help other people to grow their own food, to recreate the missing link with nature and to reduce their impact on the environment. I want to empower people with the knowledge to start their own supply of homegrown food, in order to stop relying completely on big corporations and start being more self-sufficient. You don’t need any specific skills to do this: by following some easy and basic steps you will be able to grow your own organic food at home.Supermarkets sell grow-at-home lettuce plants that stay fresh for longer.",

Indeed, the European native oyster was so plentiful in Scotland that 30 million a year were harvested from oyster beds outside Edinburgh in the 1800s.But today the species is almost extinct: populations have dropped by 85% over the past century, most likely because of overfishing from bottom trawling.A new rewilding project part-funded by the Glenmorangie distillery plans to use native oysters a water filters, which would prevent the quality of the company’s whisky from deteriorating, but also mitigate the effects of the organic waste released into the waters of Dornoch Firth.

But even if they do, onshore wind developers warn that the changes are unlikely to be sufficiently wide-ranging to kickstart significant new generation.A Downing Street spokesperson said on Monday: “We support the development of onshore wind where there is local support. Applications will continue to be decided at a local level.”Developers say the changes would still leave an effective ban in place, while Labour’s Ed Miliband promised to give onshore wind parity with other infrastructure projects.",

That is equivalent to 7% of global GDP and almost double what the world spends on education. Countries have pledged to phase out subsidies for years to ensure the price of fossil fuels reflects their true environmental costs, but have achieved little to date.Explicit subsidies, which cut the price of fuels for consumers, doubled in 2022 as countries responded to the higher energy prices resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Rich households benefited far more from these than poor ones, the IMF said. Implicit subsidies, which represent the “enormous” costs of the damage caused by fossil fuels through climate change and air pollution, made up 80% of the total.Ending the subsidies should be the centrepiece of climate action, the IMF said, and would put the world on track to restrict global heating to below 2C, as well as preventing 1.6 million air pollution deaths a year and increasing government revenues by trillions of dollars.",

The tube keeps London moving, though often in cramped, uncomfortable and unhygienic conditions.However, Beri believes she has found a way to improve travel for concerned commuters. She has developed a phone app that can direct passengers to routes that offer minimal air pollution.“The UK safe limit for healthy air is to have fewer than 25 small particles in a cubic metre of air,” said Beri. “In some places on the underground, it can top 200 per cubic metre.

It was driven by global heating resulting from huge volcanic eruptions and wiped out 95% of life on Earth.However, species are being lost today even faster than in any of the previous five mass extinctions that have struck the planet.

Shred the pork and reheat in a frying pan until it’s hot right through, then put in a warmed burger bun and top with a spoonful of kimchi.Brussel’s sprouts are like whole mini cabbages, and make a really cute and seasonal festive kimchi. Once the kimchi has started to ferment, you can leave it on the counter to ferment some more, or put it in the fridge, which will slow down the process. Either way, it should keep for months, if not years.",

Germany missed its targets on cutting consumption of gas under the cold conditions, the German grid agency said.But only a small proportion of last month’s drop in fossil fuel use should be attributed to the weather, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air analysis. The mild temperatures contributed a 6% reduction in gas demand outside the power sector – mostly for heating – while actual demand fell 26%. Within the power sector, milder temperatures can account for two percentage points of the 12% drop in demand, the analysts found.Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst and author of the report, said the data showed that accusations against the EU of falling back on climate commitments were wrong.",

During her brief premiership, Liz Truss had effectively made him the UK net zero tsar, tasked with writing a comprehensive review of the country’s progress towards achieving the legally binding target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Now Skidmore, one of the co-authors with Truss and the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng of the notorious rightwing Britannia Unchained tract, has delivered a stinging broadside against the government he is leaving.His review argues that the Conservatives have failed on nearly every aspect of net zero policy. Though it is cloaked in polite language, and couched in terms of constructive suggestions rather than hard-hitting new policy demands, there is little in its 320 pages to show the government is on track on any of the wide range of policies needed, on areas from transport to housing, farming to energy generation.",

His headline speech to the Tory party conference spoke about the sense of responsibility that his party feels for the environment.But simultaneously he is arguing that his policies will end a (make-believe) war on motorists.And while cancelling the Manchester HS2 branch and building roads may feel like a lovely thing to do for a small group of drivers, it will potentially lead to all sorts of environmental problems elsewhere.Cancelling high-speed rail to build more roads is not just a betrayal of the promise to “level up” the north, but also a weakening by stealth of net zero policies. Transport produced 24% of the UK’s total emissions in 2020, and remains the largest emitting sector in the UK. Encouraging more traffic will only increase these emissions, and will make the country more unpleasant and polluted to live in.",

This means a green light for overfishing, according to the Blue Marine Foundation.The deal for 2024, agreed by the UK, the EU and Norway, will result in 750,000 tonnes of fishing opportunities, worth £970m for the UK fleet.Mark Spencer, the fisheries minister, said scientific advice had informed deals setting 70 catch limits for fish stocks in the North Sea and north-east Atlantic, in support of a “sustainable” and profitable fishing sector.",

This has seen Labour aping Jeremy Hunt’s ludicrous emphasis on reducing the national debt. Instead, Labour must become leader of a pack of opposition parties all demanding a massive increase in expenditure on social and green infrastructure, and on the wages and conditions of those working in these areas. One recent estimate suggests that to achieve this, the next government will need to invest £220bn per year.All opposition parties should promise the next parliament will use its powers to provide the money needed to fix broken Britain. This can come from three sources. First, the estimated £55bn a year of tax breaks for pension savers must be redesigned to support employment-creating investment with social and environmental goals, as should some of the £70bn a year saved tax-free in Isas – a much-needed exercise in intergenerational solidarity.Second, increased revenue from a fairer taxation system, where the wealthier contribute far more. Finally, as a backstop for any funding shortfalls, quantitative easing should be restarted.",

Minerals are also found near hydrothermal vents and within seamounts (underwater mountains).Why is there a growing interest in deep-sea mining?The race to cut carbon emissions to combat global heating has led to a soaring demand for copper, cobalt, nickel and other ingredients needed for the energy transition. In 2040, the world’s need for many of these metals, used for electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, will be twice what it is today, according to the International Energy Agency.Demand for copper, for instance, is expected to double, from 25m tonnes in 2020, to 50m by 2050.

How the rare palm – named Pinanga subterranea – has survived is a mystery, as most plants have evolved to develop their flowers and fruit above ground to facilitate pollination and the dispersal of seeds.“Pinanga subterranea is the only known species of palm to flower and fruit below ground,” said Dr Benedikt Kuhnhäuser, a future leader fellow at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, who was part of the research team that collected specimens and ascertained that it was a new species. “Flowering and fruiting below ground is mind-boggling and seemingly paradoxical because they appear to prevent pollination and dispersal. We now know bearded pigs eat and disperse Pinanga subterranea’s fruits, but we’ve yet to find out how and by whom the flowers are pollinated.”Only a very small number of plant species have evolved to flower or fruit underground.

Since the regulator’s new powers to interfere on boardroom pay don’t kick in until next year, this year’s assessment can be considered an explainer on how a new offside rule will work.And the news from the video assistant referee is that Severn Trent, South West Water and Portsmouth Water committed offences that “did not meet our expectations”, says Ofwat, because either short- or long-term incentives were insufficiently aligned to good outcomes for customers or the environment. Does that mean the executives would have faced the humiliation of returning their dodgy rewards?Well, no, Ofwat isn’t quite saying that. The regulator’s powers of intervention are limited to ensuring customers do not pay for misaligned bonuses, but it seems there’s nothing to stop shareholders from picking up the tab.

Shelves lined the walls from floor to ceiling, all full of ingredients from the mainstream to the obscure. One product I came across back then was apple butter, a creamy, apple jam with a wonderful texture that I presume was the result of the natural pectin in the apples. It is a rare find these days, but fortunately it’s very easy to make, and stores well, too, preserving floury, past-their-best apples for a rainy day.Maple apple butterAccording to the government waste scheme Wrap, we throw away around 800,000 apples in the UK every day.

It remains unclear how climate change will affect these events in the future. As the vortex develops during autumn and into winter, westerly stratospheric winds increase in strength. But in the event of a SSW episode, stratospheric temperatures rise rapidly in the space of only a few days, leading to the weakening or even reversal of these winds. The zonal mean winds at 10hPa pressure – about 30km high – turned to an easterly direction on 15 Wednesday February, significantly displacing the polar vortex away from the North Pole.

After 11 years of subsidies, said ministers, the electric vehicle revolution had been “kickstarted”. As Britain strives to meet a 2030 target to end the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, that judgment is beginning to look a little complacent.Amid ongoing economic headwinds, data has emerged that suggests a drop-off in current demand for electric cars, despite notable public enthusiasm for their adoption in principle. Auto Trader, which hosts the country’s largest car sales website, reported this month that inquiries in relation to new electric vehicles had fallen significantly compared with last year.A number of factors are likely to be involved. As interest rates and inflation remain high, the upfront cost of a new electric car makes it more expensive in the short term than a petrol or diesel one. Falling oil prices may have diminished the immediate incentive to switch.

Under Bell’s leadership, Ealing trialled several so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), one of which has since been removed.The LTN scheme promotes walking and cycling by using planters or bollards to make some residential streets access-only for motor traffic, while allowing pedestrians and cyclists to use them as normal. While there is evidence the schemes can, over time, reduce the overall number of shorter car trips, some opponents claim they increase congestion by pushing through motor traffic on to a smaller number of streets.",

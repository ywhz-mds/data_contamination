However, demand for treated mains water, which takes time to process and deliver, was greater than we could meet,” he said.One South East Water customer accused Mr Hinton of “victim-blaming” and described his letter as “a deflection from the real issue”.Jutta Wrobel, 61, an artist in the village of Wadhurst, East Sussex, said: “It’s not a suitable response … This is a deflection from the real issue which is how to stop South East Water paying away all our money in dividends rather than reinvesting in our water infrastructure, which is a public utility and a human right.”Wrobel started an online petition demanding a change of ownership of South East Water after she was left without mains water for five days earlier this month.She added: “The barrage of victim-blaming by South East Water is what I think has riled people up.“I’m interested in what the regulator is doing about it and whether there will be meaningful sanctions imposed on South East Water.”Greg Clark, the Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells, told the Times: “Their only job is to deliver drinking water.",

Within the super reserve, 1,370 hectares of open “savannah” for free-ranging, grazing animals as it would have been thousands of years ago is being developed with the cattle, ponies and pigs roaming freely to graze alongside deer to help shape a more diverse landscape with richer habitats.David Brown, the National Trust’s lead ecologist for Purbeck, said: “Over large swathes of open grassland and heath, these domestic grazers are now mimicking their wild ancestors, who would have shaped habitats in the past.“We can’t bring back aurochs but we can use our 200 red Devon cattle to graze and behave in equivalent ways. Similarly, Exmoor ponies mimic the actions of extinct tarpan horses, and the quirky, curly coated Mangalitsa pigs are rooting around like wild boars.Mangalitsa pig.

At between 200 metres and 1,000 metres below the surface, the twilight zone is home to a variety of organisms and animals, including specially adapted fish such as lantern sharks and kitefin sharks, which have huge eyes and glowing, bioluminescent skin.“Penicillin is an antibiotic that originally came from a fungus called Penicillium so we might find something like that from these ocean fungi,” said Fabio Favoretto, a postdoctoral scholar at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. The twilight zone is characterised by high pressure, a lack of light and cold temperatures, which presents an extreme environment “where fungi might exhibit unique adaptations”, he added. “That could potentially lead to the discovery of new species with unique biochemical properties.”Deep-sea mining: why is interest growing and what are the risks?Read moreThe new ocean DNA catalogue, launched on Tuesday, contains more than 317m marine organism gene groups compiled from samples collected on voyages including the four-year Tara Oceans expedition which started in 2009, and the 2010 Malaspina Circumnavigation expedition.Advances in technology meant existing samples could provide much more data than before, while the process of cataloguing helped open new doors into the understudied ocean, said the marine biologist and the paper’s lead author, Elisa Laiolo.The marine biotechnology sector, which relies on ocean organisms and their genes, is worth an estimated $6bn, a figure expected to almost double by 2032.Laiolo was surprised to see so many fungi living in the ocean’s twilight zone. “There have been some indications of it [fungi abundance at this level] before, so this is another piece of the puzzle.”Another critical discovery made during the cataloguing process, said Carlos Duarte, a marine science professor and senior author of the study, was the role viruses played in boosting gene diversity. “The viruses insert themselves and move genes from one organism to another.",

But what are the options for the country’s largest water and sewerage company?Special administrationThis is a power within the Water Industry Act 1991 to protect essential services for the public if a private company is either on the brink of collapse, or not fulfilling its legal obligations.It arranges to transfer the business as a going concern and, just as administrators do in other financial collapses, it enables them to carry out the functions of the company until that transfer. Crucially it is designed to protect an essential public service first and creditors do not have priority in getting their loans paid off.The company can be eventually transferred to another private company, as in the case of the electricity company Bulb in 2022, when the government subsidised the continued existence of Bulb as a private company and then transferred it to another private company. But it can also be used to transfer a company into public ownership, as in the case of Railtrack. When the privatised company owning the railway network collapsed in 2002 the special administration process resulted in a transfer to public ownership under Network Rail.Public English regional water companyDavid Hall, an expert in public utilities after privatisation, suggests special administration could be used for all three of the failing water companies serving the south-east of England. Southern Water, South East Water and Thames Water could be taken into special administration and transferred into public ownership under the councils in the region as the first regional publicly owned water company.Enforcement under section 18 of the Water Industry ActUnder the Water Industry Act 1991, ministers and the regulator can issue enforcement orders for a company to do their bidding – whether it is paying down debts, restructuring, reducing payouts to shareholders or keeping water bills down. Nevertheless, this could result in ministers being involved in the running of the company for many years – effectively a nationalisation under the definition of the National Statistics Office, but without any local accountability and participation. It could be strongly resisted by the private owners.",

Locals said the mountain and the rocks on it had been moving since the last ice age, according to officials.Over the last century, the village itself has moved a few centimetres each year – but the movement has accelerated over the last 20 years, and the landslide has now been moving about one metre a year. Geological surveys suggest the situation has become even more precarious.Melting glaciers in Alps threaten biodiversity of invertebrates, says studyRead moreChristian Gartmann, a member of the crisis management board in the town of Albula, which counts Brienz in its municipality, said experts estimated there was a 60% chance that the rock would fall in smaller chunks, which may not even reach the village or the valley. It could also move slowly. But there was also a 10% chance the whole 2m cubic metres mass may tumble down – threatening lives, property and the village itself, he said.“We hope that the village stays intact,” he said by phone. “We can’t eliminate the possibility that it [the rock] will come down … It could damage the village or destroy it.”Gartmann said that glacier melt had affected the precariousness of the rocks over millennia but that glacier melt due to human-made climate change in recent decades was not a factor.",

It also will not solve grid bottlenecks holding back new solar and windfarms in the state.The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), which first proposed VNI West as a $2.7bn project in 2018 and is Victoria’s main planner for transmission, estimated users’ transmission charges would need to rise by a quarter. That assessment, though, was based on 2021 prices and ignored interest costs that have since soared.Victoria announces ban on gas connections to new homes from January 2024Read moreThe report estimates the Victorian portion of the line alone will cost $4.9bn in current dollars. Add in a further $3bn needed for upgrades to the existing 220kV networks to integrate VNI West, and the full cost could swell to $11bn and lift Victorians’ transmission charges by at least 124%.“The cost has blown out again and again and again,” said Bruce Mountain, the VEPC’s director and one of the report’s authors. “Aemo rightfully should long since have said, ‘We need to think again, this is not getting anywhere.’” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The falling price of renewables has offered nations endowed with lots of wind and sunshine potentially low-cost ways to decarbonise their economies.

Nitrogen and phosphorus naturally occur in soil, but dangerous levels are often attributed to farming byproducts, such as cattle urine. Sediment is another naturally occurring pollutant that can reach unhealthy levels due to human-caused erosion as well as urban and agricultural land use.The report found that substantial reductions of at least one of the four contaminants were required in almost all regions of the country to meet national regulations. Maps generated by the report’s data demonstrate the human impact on waterways – the sparsely populated west coast of New Zealand’s South Island shows low levels of the contaminants. However, areas such as Canterbury, which has intensive dairy farming, and Auckland, the country’s largest city, show high levels of either nitrogen or E. coli.Reducing contaminants falls to local councils, which are required to regulate farms and urban areas to improve freshwater.",

The caves are also perfect for the bats to roost in, full of nooks and crannies.”Fifteen species of bats had been recorded on the 350-acre Weston Farm site on the South Purbeck coast, making it Dorset’s most important “swarming site” – and one of national importance – with bats flying in from across the county and even farther afield to meet and mate on the wing.The bats sweep into the three cliff caves – created by quarrying for Purbeck stone – from the seaside. They can also dart into another inland cave also created by quarrying. Brown said this “speed-dating” was important to ensure the genetic health of bat populations.Among the creatures that are found there are the rare serotine and barbastelle bats. The caves are also used for winter hibernation for some of the UK’s rarest bats, such as the greater horseshoe.The land forms the eastern half of St Aldhem’s Head, and will extend the existing trust-owned “Purbeck Wares”, an important habitat for orchids and other wildflowers. The coastal strip includes ancient “strip lynchet” terraced field systems.Brown added: “We aim to create a landscape that is richer in nature, so there’ll be no chemical inputs or regular ploughing on any of the land and life will be restored to the soil using natural regenerative farming methods. As the land is given time to rest and recover, the ground will store more carbon and streams flowing off the land will be cleaner and healthier.",

        "text": "There will be many reasons why Britain’s energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, went public with her unease about “serious and concerning” allegations raised by the Guardian this week over cybersecurity, site safety and a “toxic” workplace culture in Sellafield. There was the “longstanding nature” of the matters in question, raising questions over the site’s management. Neighbouring governments have had serious concerns. The plant holds enough plutonium to potentially make thousands of atomic bombs of the size that obliterated Japan’s Nagasaki in 1945. By asking for assurances from its state-controlled owner and its regulator, Ms Coutinho emphasises that effective governance of Britain’s nuclear industry is a critical issue.This is a sensible response to these scandals. The cabinet minister is right to publicise her concerns about a hazardous industry that can inflict catastrophic environmental damage and deaths. She has sent a helpful signal about valuing public safety over secrecy. Sellafield in Cumbria, and about 20 smaller sites, need to be monitored and protected, as the waste stored can remain radioactive for tens of thousands of years. Yet the nuclear establishment is at best opaque. Britain’s postwar development of nuclear weapons grew alongside the construction of nuclear energy reactors. The industry’s military connections have influenced its approaches to corporate governance for the worse.There is an urgent problem of nuclear waste disposal. Britain was one of the first economies to generate nuclear energy. But that meant radioactive waste has been left for decades without a permanent storage solution. This has seen the cost of temporary storage soar and the risk of catastrophe increase. Sellafield is one of the most dangerous places in the world, a notoriety bolstered by crumbling buildings and tanks leaking irradiated sludge. It is no stranger to trouble, going as far as changing its name to distance itself from being the site of one of history’s worst nuclear accidents in 1957.The consensus today for an enduring answer is to bury nuclear waste deep underground in “geological disposal facilities”. Finland will open one next year. Its spent nuclear fuel will be packed in copper canisters, and these entombed in the bedrock on the Gulf of Bothnia at a depth of 400m. France and Sweden are pursuing similar schemes.",

It was dismissed as “profoundly silly”, “a ludicrous popcorn thriller” informed by “lousy science”, and some scientists argued it depicted meteorological phenomena “as occurring over days, instead of decades or centuries”.Storm Elliott, the “bomb cyclone” that hit the US over the holidays, should have made some of those critics uncomfortable. Temperatures in places plunged in just a few minutes as one of the greatest North American storms ever recorded swept down from the Arctic to Mexico, sometimes at hurricane speed. It brought death, chaos and misery for tens of millions of people.Fierce Christmas storms and bomb cyclones are not that unusual in the US but Elliott was remarkable chiefly for its continental scale, lightning speed and intensity. Scientists have yet to calculate the degree to which it might be linked to human actions and increased CO2 levels, but it clearly fits the IPCC’s widely predicted pattern of climate intensification and unprecedented global heat, cold and atmospheric turbulence.Less noticed than Storm Elliott but possibly just as significant were the disastrous Christmas floods in the Philippines and Brazil, and the worryingly warm holiday period experienced across much of Europe in the past 10 days.

If it did not, New Zealand would fail to reach net zero emissions by 2050, the writers added.“Our current pathway of policies will not get us there,” the chair of the commission, Rod Carr, told reporters in Wellington on Wednesday.New Zealand scraps transport emissions reform to fund welfare increaseRead moreHis remarks struck a cautious note a year after New Zealand’s Labour government unveiled the most sweeping and ambitious plan to reduce emissions in the country’s history, with a policy programme that included dozens of proposed actions.Jacinda Ardern, then New Zealand’s prime minister, said when she announced the plan – which was also based on the Commission’s advice – that the climate crisis was a matter of “life or death”. A law passed by her government enshrines in law the target of net zero emissions and a reduction in biogenic methane emissions by 24%-47% by 2050.New Zealand has built a global brand through its presentation as a “clean, green” paradise. But while the agricultural country of 5 million’s share of global greenhouse gas emissions is small, its gross emissions per capita are high and it has been one of the world’s worst performers on emission increases.Emissions in New Zealand rose 57% between 1990 and 2018 – the second-greatest increase of all industrialised countries.",

Ministers are to consult on the future homes standard from next month, and it will take effect from 2025.Juliet Phillips, of the E3G thinktank, who organised the letter, said: “Connecting new built homes to the gas grid, during a gas crisis, is a disaster for energy bills, energy security, and the climate emergency. Experts have repeatedly concluded that hydrogen will not provide a nationwide solution for heat decarbonisation.”She said: “Hydrogen-ready boilers could act as a wolf in sheep’s clothing, allowing new homes to be connected to the gas grid, with little chance they will be supplied with green hydrogen anytime soon. We encourage the government to instead firmly double down on readily available clean tech solutions such as heat pumps.",

If the government is going to reduce direct support for business energy bills, then perhaps the policy focus should turn to how they can offset this by using tax and investment incentives, the design of energy markets, and greater financial reward for the demand side, allowing businesses to offset financial pressures, as well as maintain their pursuit of net zero,” he said.The new bills scheme will see companies get a discount on wholesale gas and electricity prices for a year instead of the current system, which caps costs.Manufacturers with heavy energy usage, such as glass and steelmakers, will get a greater discount.

We are the ones that implement the law.”State officials also drew a distinction between the law being challenged – a provision of the Montana Environmental Protection Act that they characterized as “procedural” – and regulatory acts such as the Clean Air Act of Montana.Only regulatory acts can be used as the basis for permit rejections, and those don’t allow permits to be denied in Montana based on climate impacts, said the DEQ air, energy and mining division administrator, Sonja Nowakowski.",

But finance minister Grant Robertson promised in remarks at parliament on Thursday that attention would then turn to increasing the “resilience” of New Zealand’s infrastructure to cope with increasing climate-related weather disasters.New Zealand budget 2023: Chris Hipkins focuses on young families suffering in cost of living crisisRead moreThe funding includes $300m for “significant upgrades” to roads for slip prevention, flood mitigation, and managing the risk of rising seas, said Michael Wood, the transport minister, in a statement.“It was unacceptable that basic lifeline services like telecommunications, power and transport links were knocked out for so long,” Robertson added, referring to the recent cyclone and storms.With damage from the twin disasters expected to cost billions, Robertson had warned that this year’s budget would be a no frills document, prompting questions about how the Labour government would balance the cost of weather clean-up and recovery with years of promised commitments to curbing greenhouse gas emissions.Megan Woods, the energy and resources minister, said in a statement on Thursday that the government’s investments would do both, making the transport network “more resilient to weather events, and climate friendly”.Measures to address emissions included $120m over four years to expand the country’s electric vehicle charging network, Woods said, with a focus on rural areas. A partnership with the private sector will produce up to 23 hubs, each supplying up to 20 EV chargers.A grant was announced for purchases of low emissions heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses to incentivise change to a national vehicle fleet that’s among the world’s oldest and dirtiest.Funds were also pledged for adaptation in remote communities, such as Westport in the South Island, that are most threatened by floods, storms and sea level rises.",

But that pledge has so far gone unmet, with only $83bn provided in 2020.Estimates suggest that the $100bn figure should be exceeded this year, but Oxfam said standard estimates overstated the true amounts. That is because some of the money has been taken from existing overseas aid budgets, and some of what is counted as climate finance includes funds primarily allocated to development projects such as health and education, with only tangential benefits to the climate.Oxfam also argues that finance should be provided in the form of grants rather than loans, though some donor countries defend the use of loans.If all of these sums are stripped out, then only $21bn to $24.5bn of the $83bn remains as pure climate finance without strings attached, according to Oxfam in its Climate Finance Shadow Report 2023, published on Monday.Climate finance will come under close scrutiny this week, at UN negotiations to be held in Bonn, ahead of the Cop28 climate summit that starts on 30 November.",

It is unclear whether the latest breach will lead to a financial penalty.A woodchip pile at a Amite BioEnergy site. Photograph: DraxThe notice of violation, issued in March, said the company was permitted to emit 24 tons (22 tonnes) a year of hazardous air pollutants on a rolling 12-month basis, but reached as much as 37 tons between January 2021 and December 2022, peaking in July 2022.The MDEQ asked Amite for an explanation and what action it had taken to correct the violation.In response, Drax argued that pellet production was a relatively young industry, adding: “Several wood pellet facilities, not only Amite BioEnergy, initially underestimated emissions in connection with the permitting of these facilities.“Amite BioEnergy has a history of acting quickly to update emissions and permits upon discovery of new emission factors and new information pertaining to other pellet production plants.”Amite argued that, according to its analysis, it was only non-compliant for a short period – between late October and early November 2021.Great Britain’s energy regulator, Ofgem, has launched an investigation, which will be carried out by the US consulting group Black & Veatch, over whether Drax’s operations are aligned with biomass sustainability rules.Last year, the UK government was accused of funding “environmental racism” in the US south by providing subsidies to Drax.",

However, some opponents of climate action claim it is too expensive. They argue that rapidly scaling back fossil fuel production would leave billions of pounds of “stranded assets”, leading to an economic slump that would impoverish the public through a fall in the value of savings and pension funds.Research published on Thursday finds that the loss of fossil fuel assets would have a minimal impact on the general public.“We find that the bulk of financial losses associated with rotten, polluting assets is borne by the wealthy,” said the co-author Lucas Chancel, a professor of economics at Sciences Po in Paris. “Only a small share of financial losses is borne by the working and middle class because they have no or relatively little financial wealth.”The study, published in the journal Joule, found that in high-income countries two-thirds of the financial losses would be borne by the most affluent 10%. In contrast, governments could easily compensate for the minimal impact on those on middle and lower levels of wealth.Chancel said: “These latter groups have nothing to fear from rapid action, in particular if governments decide to compensate for their losses, which can be done at relatively low cost.”The study found that in the US, two-thirds of the financial losses from lost fossil fuel assets would affect the top 10% of wealth holders, with half of that affecting the top 1%.Because the wealthiest people tend to have a “diverse portfolio of investments”, it found, any losses would still make up less than 1% of this group’s net wealth.Just 3.5% of financial losses from stranded assets would affect the poorest half of Americans and could easily be compensated for by government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

This area, spanning around 250,000 sq miles, is critical as a water resource for cities, cropland and wildlife but has withered under the region’s worst drought in at least 1,200 years.A new hydrological model developed for the new study shows that warming temperatures – the basin is 1.5C (2.7F) hotter on average than it was in 1880 – has led to a 10.3% reduction in water runoff.",

Additionally, damp meadows have been drained, leading to substantial declines in plants such as devil’s-bit scabious – a plant fed on by rare butterflies.introduced plant species mapAncient arable wildflowers such as corn marigold fared worse than other species; with a 62% decline. This is because traditional grasslands have been reseeded or over-fertilised.Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: “The decline of our beautiful native plants is heartbreaking and has consequences for us all. The loss of natural habitats due to modern farming methods over the last 70 years has been an unmitigated disaster for wildflowers and all the species that depend on them including insects, bats and birds.“But it’s not too late to stop this catastrophe. The government’s new farm environment schemes must do what was originally promised and reverse the decline of nature in our agricultural landscape. Also, protection for local wildlife sites needs to be increased, and the promise made by the government at the recent UN biodiversity summit to halve nutrient pollution by 2030 must be honoured.”Climate breakdown has affected many species. For example, mountain plants such as alpine lady-fern, alpine speedwell and snow pearlwort depend on areas where the snow lies late in the spring and summer.Of the 3,445 different plant species recorded during fieldwork, 1,692 are native to Britain while 1,753 non-natives were found that have been deliberately or accidentally introduced into the wild by humans.",

Some private landowners, such as national trusts and some farmers, open their land and pathways for people to walk in and that is not included in the 8% figure.In Scotland, there is a right to walk through the countryside, leaving no trace, with some exceptions such as not trampling over land that is growing crops. Under a Labour government, people in England would be granted the same rights.The right to roam campaign has been gaining momentum, with thousands of people having taken part in mass trespasses last summer to demand more access to the countryside.Sobel said: “Labour’s approach, like in Scotland, will be that Labour’s right to roam will offer access to high-quality green and blue space in the rest of Britain. We will replace the default of exclusion with a default of access.“Research shows that people with a stronger connection to nature were more likely to behave positively towards the environment. It’s quite simple: the more people engage with nature, the more likely they are to protect it.”He pointed out that access to nature was unfairly distributed in England, with people from minority ethnic groups and those in less affluent areas less likely to have accessible green space nearby.“Labour will create a future where nature thrives, people have a deeper connection to the environment, and people have equal access to the benefits of green spaces,” the MP for Leeds North West added.Jim McMahon, the shadow environment secretary, previously said that in government he would extend the right to roam but did not say a Scottish-style system would be in place.",

Gardeners take pictures or samples of afflicted trees, crops or flowers and send them in to the plant pathologists, who can identify the disease.This year, seven of 2022’s 10 most prevalent garden diseases relate to fruit, which the RHS says is the highest it has seen. Apple and pear canker also entered the top 10 for the first time in recent years.Traditional British garden under threat from extreme heat, says RHSRead moreDr Liz Beal, a plant pathologist at the RHS, said: “This is a direct result of last year’s extreme summer heat, which caused many plants to become stressed and therefore more susceptible to problems when rain, coupled with continuing mild temperatures in the autumn, provided the perfect breeding ground for diseases to spread. Spores of most fungi need warm, wet weather to spread and infect plants.”While many of these diseases simply cause fruit to rot or give an unsightly appearance, others can be deadly. Particularly worrying is a rise in silverleaf, which can destroy blossoming cherry trees.She explained: “With warm weather predicted again this year, gardeners can act now to minimise the risks by pruning apples and pear that are still dormant and avoiding pruning Prunus – flowering cherry – until the summer. This is as Prunus is susceptible to silver leaf and the fungi is less active during the summer months.”Horticulturalists are keeping a keen eye out for new diseases and invasive species, as warming weather combined with the international plant trade means that it is becoming more likely the UK will experience new outbreaks.Blueberries fruiting in England.

The hoax had been designed by Fridays For Future and the Yes Men. At a morning press conference the real group behind the claim revealed themselves.The campaign group Market Forces, which focuses on finance for fossil fuels, also said it would be using the shares it owns in the bank to lodge a shareholder resolution for the 2022 AGM if the bank’s policies on climate change did not improve. “We expect to attract significant support,” said their spokesperson, Adam McGibbon.The Liverpool campaign was coordinated by the activist group Brandalism. Tona Merriman, a campaigner with the group, said: “Subvertising is about using creative arts practices to directly speak back to the brands that use advertising to hide their corporate practices. Whether that’s big polluters like Shell, BP or their financiers like HSBC or Standard Chartered.”Standard Chartered has been Liverpool’s main sponsor since 2010, making it one of the longest-running sponsorship agreements in the club’s history. Activists say the partnership is inappropriate because the UK-based bank has loaned billions to fund destructive fossil fuel projects.“Liverpool have a fanbase that are proud of their progressive, working-class history and I think a lot of fans will disagree with the environmental crimes their main sponsor is committing,” said Merriman.One of the poster designs features the Standard Chartered logo, with the tagline: “Supporting deforestation, flash floods and Liverpool FC.”A Brandalism poster at a bus stop in Liverpool.",

At 3%, mammals are the group least associated with soils.“Here, we show that soil is likely home to 59% of life including everything from microbes to mammals, making it the singular most biodiverse habitat on Earth,” researchers write in the paper, which is a review of existing literature. The actual figure could be even higher as soils are so understudied, they say.Before this study, scientists did not know what the most species-rich habitat was, says the lead researcher, Dr Mark Anthony, an ecologist at the Swiss Federal Research Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research. “In my research circle, many suspected it should be soil but there was no evidence.”He added: “Organisms in soil play an outweighed impact on the balance of our planet. Their biodiversity matters because soil life affects climate change feedbacks, global food security, and even human health.”Soil is the top layer of the Earth’s crust and is composed of a mixture of water, gases, minerals and organic matter. It is where 95% of the planet’s food is grown yet it has historically been left out of wider debates about nature protections because we know so little about it. One teaspoon of healthy soil can contain up to a billion bacteria and more than 1km of fungi.Researchers used the rough estimate of there being about 100bn species in total. They then used theoretical estimates and data analysis to work out what fraction of those species were found in the soil. They defined a species as living in the soil if it lived within it, on it, or completed part of its lifecycle in it.",

Together, they make a comprehensive review of global knowledge of the climate.The first three sections covered the physical science of the climate crisis, including observations and projections of global heating, the impacts of the climate crisis and how to adapt to them, and ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They were published in August 2021, February and April 2022 respectively.The synthesis report also includes three other shorter IPCC reports published since 2018, on the impacts of global heating of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, climate change and land, and climate change and the oceans and cryosphere (the ice caps and glaciers).What will the key findings be?There is no new science in the synthesis report, just a recap of the main findings of the previous publications. Those include warnings that the world was approaching “irreversible” levels of global heating, with catastrophic impacts rapidly becoming inevitable; and that it was “now or never” to take drastic action to avoid disaster.Much of the synthesis report is likely to focus on the future, setting out the possible policies and actions that will stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown and warning of the impacts of further heating.If the main findings have already been published, why is this report needed?Its purpose is to reduce the thousands of pages of science to a shorter format, which is further condensed into a “summary for policymakers”, to provide scientific underpinning for global climate action. It is written by scientists but haggled over by representatives of the UN’s nearly 200 governments, so some argue it is subject to watering down by regimes that do not like its messages.The report is supposed to inform the next UN climate summit, Cop28, which will be hosted by the United Arab Emirates in Dubai from 30 November.

In January, a judge ruled in his favour, ending the decades-long assumption that wild camping was allowed.‘Nothing can take its place’: dismayed Dartmoor wild campers share memoriesRead moreHowever, lawyers for the park argue the judgment could be flawed because it hinges on a narrow definition of open-air recreation, where only activities such as walking, horse riding and picnicking are permitted. They also argue that it fails to take into account the historical understanding of the law, which thousands of people, including the park authority, understood to mean a right to camp and leave no trace.The court of appeals judge, Lady Justice Asplin, ruled that these reasons crossed the threshold for an appeal, and that it was conceivable that the previous judge presiding over the case misconstrued the meaning of open-air recreation, which could include wild camping.The Dartmoor Preservation Association is fundraising for the appeal. Tom Usher, CEO of the DPA, said: “It’s a travesty that, at a time when the national park is operating under a 48% real-term budget cut over the last 12 years, that we should also be facing the loss of access rights at a time when the benefits of nature-connectedness have never been more vital.

Scientists now say they have some answers as to why yields of honey have declined, pointing to environmental degradation that is affecting all sorts of bees, and insects more generally.The amount of honey produced by honeybee colonies in the US has dropped by around half a pound, on average, per colony in the past decade, US government data shows, even as the number of managed colonies increased slightly.“You go to meetings with beekeepers and you’ll hear all the time they are not producing honey like they used to,” said Gabriela Quinlan, a research fellow in Penn State’s department of entomology and center for pollinator research. “It’s something we see across the board in different states.”A new study, led by Quinlan, has analyzed the factors affecting the amount of flowers growing in different regions, which is a key factor in the amount of honey produced by honeybees after they forage. Honeybees need nectar, pollen and water, collected from the surrounding environment, to make honey.The research found that several factors are hampering honeybees’ ability to create honey, including an explosion in the use of herbicides, the conversion of previously flower-rich land into monocultural farmland and a decline in soil productivity.A major factor, since the early 1990s, in honey production has been the changing climate, with rising temperatures, altered rainfall patterns and extreme weather events wreaking havoc upon many beekeepers and their broods.“It’s just so weather-dependent,” said Christina Grozinger, study co-author and Penn State entomologist. “It’s not just getting warmer and wetter, there are also these extreme events that mean you don’t know what weather you’ll be getting.“You can’t really manage for that. We can manage the land in terms of reducing pesticides but long term we are going to have to think about what plants we can plant with these changing climatic conditions.”Honeybee colonies have suffered severe losses during winters in recent years, with habitat loss, the climate crisis, pesticides and disease all taking their toll.",

Many studies have shown that urban greenery levels reflect socioeconomic inequality, with people on low incomes less likely to live within a five-minute walk of green space or to live on green streets.The thinktank is also calling on the prime minister to declare a national mission to regreen all Britain’s towns and cities, including a national competition to celebrate the best examples, support for commemorative tree schemes, and spreading resources and guidance on greening.Create Streets conducted a cost-benefit analysis into building small new parks in an urban area, finding a positive impact valued at £6,495 per person living within 500 metres of the green space.

The disease can lead to the gradual breakdown of tubular glands in the proventriculus. Losing these glands can cause the birds to become more vulnerable to infection and parasites and affect their ability to digest food and absorb some vitamins.Researchers called the fibrotic disease plasticosis to make it clear that it was caused by plastic in the environment.When birds ingest small pieces of plastic, they found, it inflames the digestive tract. Over time, the persistent inflammation causes tissues to become scarred and disfigured, affecting digestion, growth and survival.Natural materials found in the stomachs of birds, such as pumice stones, did not cause the same problems, leading scientists to label this a specifically plastic-caused disease.Bond, principal curator in charge of birds at the Natural History Museum, said: “While these birds can look healthy on the outside, they’re not doing well on the inside. This study is the first time that stomach tissue has been investigated in this way and shows that plastic consumption can cause serious damage to these birds’ digestive system.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

Each tiger was rated, on average, by more than three people.The results from Harbin Siberian tiger park revealed the words formed two main clusters when applied to the big cats, with these clusters replicated in the second group of tigers.The researchers dubbed these clusters “majesty” and “steadiness”.

Like the international court of justice, which was tasked with giving its view on states’ legal duties on the climate emergency earlier this year, the tribunal’s opinion will not be legally binding, but it will be highly influential.In its submission to the tribunal, seen by the Guardian, the NGO Opportunity Green argues that the law of the sea already obliges all countries to combat vessel pollution and therefore hold the shipping industry accountable for its greenhouse gas emissions.Carly Hicks, the legal director of Opportunity Green, said states had largely delegated their environmental responsibilities over shipping to the IMO. Last year, the UN body finally agreed that some form of action was needed and said that would include a market-based economic element, such as a levy, cap and trade scheme or a reward system, and a technical element, most likely a global fuel standard.There is growing support for the idea of a levy among states and the shipping industry. But IMO members still do not agree on what form it should take, or whether the money should be spent solely on decarbonising the industry or to further climate action elsewhere.The IMO will discuss a revised greenhouse strategy in July. A spokesperson, Natasha Brown, said it “certainly” expected the meeting to agree on the way forward for technical and economic measures.",

Mountain Valley has just 20 miles (30km) left to complete but is several years behind schedule due to opposition from green groups and nearby residents who risk having their land taken for the project.However, Joe Manchin, the West Virginia senator, coal baron and the Senate’s leading beneficiary of campaign donations from gas pipeline interests, has vigorously lobbied for the pipeline’s construction and appears to have prevailed in his quest. Manchin, a centrist Democrat, is considered a valued swing vote in an evenly divided Senate.",

ClientEarth says this breaches the international code on responsible business conduct.The lawyers behind the complaint have stressed the urgency of the issue because Amazon degradation is approaching a tipping point, after which scientists say the rainforest will turn into dry grassland, emitting vast amounts of carbon dioxide. The Amazon’s sister biome, the Cerrado, has already lost half of its tree cover.The lawyers say they hope the legal challenge will raise standards at Cargill – which is the biggest privately owned company in the US, with revenues last year of $165bn (£131bn) – and set an example across the industry.Laura Dowley, a lawyer at ClientEarth, said: “Cargill has vast resources at its disposal to implement due diligence. The technology is already there. We aren’t asking it to do anything it doesn’t have the resources to do. We hope it will show leadership.”Cargill has promised to be “deforestation-free” in the Amazon and Cerrado by 2025 and completely eradicate deforestation from all its supply chains by 2030. The company says it has put in place a sophisticated monitoring operation at ports, warehouses and other points in its supply chain. ClientEarth said it identified several shortcomings in this system, including a lack of environmental due diligence on: Soya beans bought from third-party traders, which make up 42% of all Brazilian soya Cargill purchases. Soya beans owned by other companies that passes through Cargill ports. Indirect land use change. Soya sourced from the Cerrado savannah. Soya sourced from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.",

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Pieris rapae is colloquially referred to as a cabbage moth, but is in fact a butterfly.It is an invasive species originally from Europe, considered a pest in Australia because it will snack on any plant from the brassica family, which includes lettuce, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale and brussels sprouts.The insect goes through distinct stages of growth, starting at hatching from an egg and turning into a larva.“That is when they will damage your plants,” Elgar said.The larva feeds on plants until they have expanded beyond their exoskeletons and go through a moulting phase. Then it wraps silk around its body and “goes through this extraordinary metamorphosis where it changes into a butterfly”.Female adults then “search for somewhere to lay their eggs,” which tend to be the underside of leaves.Elgar said the cabbage butterfly influx was occurring in Melbourne and Sydney but “probably hidden in places in-between as well”.“I am sure it is not just an urban city thing.”Gardeners across several states have been taking to social media with images and anecdotes of a “plague” of larvae “decimating” brassica plants and adult butterflies hovering around their gardens.“The reason for that would be the climate,” said Dr Thomas White, an ecologist from the University of Sydney.A mild winter meant more pupate survived than usual. A very warm start to spring, with days as hot as 40C combined with a few inches of rain, created “ideal butterfly and insect conditions” for an abundance of adults to survive and continue laying eggs for the start of a new 30-day reproductive cycle.",

Sperm concentration levels have dropped by 51% in recent decades, and the Rutgers study is among the first “to suggest that the air around is contributing to that, as well”, Barrett added.PM2.5 is among the most common and well-studied air pollutants, and is linked to cancer and respiratory and circulatory disease. Among common sources are diesel exhaust, heavy industry emissions and wildfires, and the Environmental Protection Agency is poised to lower ambient air limits as evidence of its toxicity at smaller exposures becomes clearer.Nitrogen oxide is a common toxin linked to cardiopulmonary disease, decreased lung function growth in children, asthma and other respiratory ailments.

He told investors at the New York stock exchange that he wanted to “reward our shareholders today and far into the future”. While saying he wanted to lower emissions, he also repeatedly emphasised his belief that oil and gas would be required for the long term.In its strategy in 2021, Shell said it would aim for “an expected gradual reduction in oil production of around 1-2% each year, including divestments and natural decline”.However, Shell argued on Wednesday that the previous strategy did not constitute a commitment to cutting oil production steadily.It said it had in fact hit the target within seven months of announcing it because of the $9.5bn sale later in 2021 of its interest in al project in the Permian Basin, Texas. Shell’s output was 1.9m barrels of oil a day in 2019, and dropped to 1.5mls a day – a 21% decline.A Shell spokesperson: “Our target of a reduction in oil production by 2030 has not changed.

Data from the consultancy PwC shows the number of jobs being created in the renewable energy industry is growing four times faster than the overall UK employment market. But more than one-third of these roles are based in London and the south-east, particularly in professional and scientific roles.The report argues that public ownership of energy firms would help to ensure a “just energy transition” offering greater job security and conditions. It paints a picture of long stints at sea and low pay in the face of the cost of living crisis, with British workers paid three times as much as migrant staff.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has said that, if his party gains power, it will create a publicly owned energy company called Great British Energy to invest in clean UK power. Labour is yet to flesh out details of the plan.Julie*, who handles transport and accommodation for workers heading into the North Sea off Aberdeen, said: “Public ownership would mean decent contracts, permanent work, and that workers would be treated with respect.

When watching the original 1994 movie, I bolted from the theater the moment the benevolent lion king Mufasa died, not yet able to stomach the idea of a life so abruptly lost. It was only recently that I returned to a theater to see the second half of the movie, this time the 2019 reboot. This time I was surprised to be overcome by a different form of grief.Over the course of the nearly two-hour, photorealistic movie, I felt a creeping sadness as the lush, biodiverse African savanna – a mixed grassland-woodland ecosystem – turned to desert. All signs of green vanish. Antelope bones litter the dry land. The lions cower in fear while looking onto the remains of their homeland – the dusty, dried-up earth and the craggy, leafless trees. Eventually, at the height of destruction, fire engulfs everything.“This isn’t the home I remember,” Nala says. The lions are experiencing “solastalgia”, a term for the specific kind of grief that comes from witnessing the loss of your home environment, often in relation to climate change.While the ecological destruction of the Pride Lands was present in the 1994 version of the movie, it takes on a more visceral quality in the 2019 version. This is in part due to the unnervingly realistic 3D animation, intended to capture the “spectacle of a BBC wildlife documentary”. But it is also because this kind of loss is all too familiar to an audience witnessing the earth hurtle towards a climate breakdown.The Lion King review – resplendent but pointlessRead moreYet the climate crisis goes unacknowledged in the reboot. As Disney’s highest-grossing animated movie of all time, it could have been a real opportunity to talk about the tragic experience the audience shares with the lions: the unprecedented, rapid destruction of earth.

These are actions that cause widespread, substantial and irreversible or long-lasting damage to large or important ecosystems, habitats or the quality of air, soil or water.This closely follows a definition of ecocide developed by an international panel of legal experts in 2021. The definition was mainly intended to be adopted by the international criminal court through an amendment to the Rome statute – the key goal of the Stop Ecocide Foundation – but is now increasingly being used for national-level legislation. Scotland, for example, recently began consulting on whether to introduce the UK’s first ecocide law.The revised EU law specifies which kinds of environmental activities are covered. These include water abstraction, ship recycling and pollution, the introduction and spread of invasive alien species, and ozone destruction. But it does not say anything about fishing, the export of toxic waste to developing countries or carbon market fraud.Having a permit to carry out listed activities will not automatically be an excuse. Individuals and companies will have committed a crime if that authorisation was obtained fraudulently or by corruption, extortion or coercion, or if it breaches substantive legal requirements.Lawmakers did not agree to extend these obligations to offences committed outside EU borders on behalf of EU companies, but individual member states would be able to choose to do this.The law introduces new penalties, ranging from prison sentences for individuals to exclusion from access to public funds for companies.",

He said it was “suspicious” that the discharge happened after the site was put up for sale.The judge said: “Though I don’t believe anybody directed the TBT should be washed out of the tanks, it is suspicious that the TBT was only discharged when a potential purchaser for whom the presence of TBT in the tanks was a serious problem came along.”He added: “I am quite satisfied that the defendant, having closed its eyes for years to the problem, operated a reckless system in which it utterly failed to control the management of TBT and other chemicals. I’m satisfied that [a caretaker] emptied the TBT into the estuary and that is something that should never have been allowed to happen.”The judge, sitting at Plymouth crown court, also raised concerns about what he called “astronomic” levels of mercury that were also found in the river.

Other species were found to be increasing in body size, such as plants in the Arctic.Scientists are still researching the causes of such changes in body sizes, some of which exceed 10%, but they have suggested it may be the consequence of global heating and overconsumption – defining features of the Anthropocene, the proposed term for our geological epoch that describes humanity’s impact on the Earth.The report supports other findings about shrinking fish sizes in the North Sea and smaller Pacific salmon in Alaska, which some researchers believe is linked to the climate crisis.The thorny skate is among the fish that have become smaller.

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Regulators across the world have introduced some PFAS bans, including on PFOA (also known as C8), PFOS and PFHxS, out of concerns for their potential health impacts. A large epidemiological study has found, for example, that exposure to PFOA may be associated with conditions including testicular and kidney cancer, thyroid disease and pregnancy-induced hypertension.Australian manufacturers of period underwear contacted by Guardian Australia have ruled out the presence of PFAS in their goods.The undergarment company Modibodi said it used a combination of fabrics and specific sewing techniques to make leak-proof linings in its products. “Modibodi does not design products that require the functionality of PFAS,” it said in a statement.“While there are some variations across styles, our lining layers include 100% Merino wool for its breathability and natural odour control, polyester/polymamide for absorbency and a thin polyester layer for its lightness and durability.”“We don’t use PFAS and test our fabrics and products to Oeko-tex Standard 100, which tests for PFAS.",

Any practices that fall short of their high standards will not be tolerated.”In the Netherlands, in which the Guardian uncovered numerous allegations of migrant workers suffering in abusive conditions, the Dutch food retail association Centraal Bureau Levensmiddelenhandel (CBL) said it was important to supermarkets in the country that safe and secure working conditions were present in their supply chains.However, it said it was the government’s responsibility, at national and European level, to police law-breaking.The CBL said in a statement: “The Dutch supermarkets are continuously working on making their supply chains more sustainable, both in collaboration with supply chain partners, but also with NGOs, trade unions and the government.“As an example, we have signed the international responsible business conduct agreement for the food products sector. As part of this agreement, we have been working over the last years on implementing due diligence following the UN guiding principles and OECD guidelines to increase transparency within our supply chains and mitigate among other human rights and social risks.“The use of certification schemes and standards is key in this process of risk mitigation.”Among individual retailers, there were differences in approaches to monitoring the welfare of workers in meat supply chains.The UK retailers that responded to the Guardian’s request for comment said they followed the BRC’s anti-slavery protocols for supermarkets responding to reported cases of forced labour, human trafficking, debt bondage and other forms of modern slavery in their supply chain.",

But after failing to take Boris Johnson’s old seat of Uxbridge, Starmer and several of his team urged the Labour mayor to think again.Both camps will hope the new proposals reduce the political pressure including attacks by Rishi Sunak’s government and many Tory MPs who argue the expansion is poorly timed given cost-of-living pressures.The enhanced scrappage programme, which takes the previous £110m cost to £160m, the extra paid for out of city hall reserves, keeps the basic grant for a car or van at £2,000 but makes everyone in the city with a non-compliant vehicle eligible.The £2,000 payments were previously only available to people who receive one of a series of benefits, including child benefit and universal credit.Khan’s officials argue that £2,000 is a sufficient sum. They say one vehicle sales website showed almost 5,000 Ulez-compliant cars for sale for less within 200 miles of central London.",

The area was determined to be common because it counts as “waste land of a manor” and under the law this means the public has access rights. The land, which comprises a mixture of grass, shrub and trees, has now been added to the common-land register, and the public has the right to walk there.Although it is almost 4 miles (6km) from his home, Gascoyne-Cecil objected to the application.Frances Kerner, the OSS’s commons re-registration officer, said: “I am delighted that the land at Wildhill Road has been added to the register of common land and that the public will be able to enjoy its beauty.“Ironically, the marquess recently hosted Future Countryside, an important conference tasked with discussing the many challenges faced by people who live in, work in and visit the countryside. Disappointingly, the society was not invited to the conference, but we hope that any future events held by the organisation will include the society and others who champion access to our splendid countryside.”In 1969, the land was provisionally registered as common but, according to the OSS, following an objection that year, the provisional registration was cancelled.",

Now they may pay the priceRead moreKannon Shanmugam, representing the industry, told the court that if the city were to succeed in state court, and win billions of dollars in compensation, that could kill offshore drilling.“The relief that Baltimore seeks would deter, if not render entirely impractical, any further production on the outer continental shelf,” he said.Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University who specialises in climate litigation, called the claim one of a number of “scare tactics” deployed by the oil industry as it fights to move the Baltimore case and other cases out of state jurisdictions, where consumer protection and other laws favour the plaintiffs, and into federal courts, where the fossil fuel companies believe they have the advantage.“It’s a scare tactic, which is telling the courts to back off, we’re a very powerful industry and we’re essential right now to energy security. If you step into this, you’re going to screw everything up,” she said.Baltimore’s case accuses oil firms of breaching Maryland state consumer protection and other laws by running disinformation campaigns to cover up what they knew about the dangers of burning fossil fuels.The outcome of Tuesday’s hearing will influence similar cases within the same federal jurisdiction, including a suit by Charleston, South Carolina. It may also have a bearing on nearly a dozen other lawsuits by states and municipalities in other jurisdictions. A federal appeals court in Hawaii is scheduled to hear a similar case next month.Shanmugam told the court that the case should fall under federal jurisdiction because pollution is regulated by national laws, and the climate crisis is a national and international issue.",

But the bull’s arrival from Germany had been delayed by five months due to post-Brexit paperwork complexities. The herd also has a young calf, thanks to a surprise birth in September.The bull arrived on Friday but it was three hours before it chose to leave the transporter, perhaps deterred by the pouring rain and a little sluggish after sedation during the journey. In the end, the sight of the females reportedly appeared to tempt the bull out. Bison are gentle giants and the completed herd sniffed, nuzzled and ate together for a while, before retreating into the woodland.The project is a collaboration between the Kent Wildlife Trust and the Wildwood Trust, and aims to use the free-living bison as “ecosystem engineers” to naturally rewild a former pine wood plantation. Bison’s taste for bark kills some trees and their bulk opens up trails, letting light spill on to the forest floor, while their love of rolling around in dust baths creates more open ground for new plants, invertebrates and birds.Mark Habben of the Wildwood Trust said: “The arrival of the bull marks the start of the Wilder Blean journey in earnest and it’s incredibly fitting that it coincides with a new year. I feel a bit emotional to be honest, it’s been such a long time in the making.”Stan Smith of the Kent Wildlife Trust said: “We want to demonstrate that a hands-off, nature-based solution exists to combat the climate and biodiversity crises we face, and intend that the Wilder Blean Project will become a blueprint for other organisations to take forward.”The Kent project expects the herd will breed and is licensed for up to 10 bison. In future, it hopes to provide bison to found other herds in the UK, as well as exchanging animals across Europe.",

It also runs counters to the US voters’ political views based on new polling shared exclusively with the Guardian and Floodlight.floodlight embedThe power plant rules, first proposed in May, would force power providers to clean up certain large coal- and gas-fired plants, either by installing new greener technologies or shutting the projects down. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is asking states and utilities to submit plans on how they choose to limit those emissions within 24 months of the rules’ final approval.Public comments must be submitted by 8 August.EEI is circulating a draft comment on the rule to its member groups which were described by first-hand sources to Craig Segall, vice-president of policy at Evergreen Action. The draft says EPA’s proposed transition timelines are too strict and that the technology it would require is difficult to install, Segall said.EEI has previously asked the EPA to exclude these power plants from its emission-reduction rule in a series of white papers submitted to the agency.“EEI is working with our members to finalize extensive comments that are intended to help EPA develop final rules that support the ongoing clean energy transition, prioritize customer affordability and are legally durable,” EEI spokesperson Brian Reil said in an email. “There are elements of the proposal that are favorable, and we are making recommendations to strengthen them; elements that are fixable with additional flexibilities; and elements that miss the mark.”The proposal would serve the White House’s goals to zero-out power sector emissions by 2035 and achieve a net-zero economy by 2050.Power plant emissions made up roughly one-quarter of the carbon emissions in the US last year, federal data shows. Electric companies have been closing older, less-efficient coal-fired plants over the past decade, and 50 EEI members have announced carbon-reduction goals, according to the lobbying group.Utilities from the west coast to the south-east began announcing emission-reduction goals towards the end of the last decade.",

His major scientific contribution concerned his work on octopuses, in which he was engaged for most of his life.Andrew’s study into why cephalopods change colour in complex patterns demonstrated that it was not just about camouflage but ways of communicating and expressing feelings.He was very critical of what he called the genetic determinists, who somehow “missed the magic” of nature. He understood the theory of evolution as being about organisms as a whole and not just genes, and he argued that contemporary evolutionary theory, which is focused on genes, fails to take into account feelings (affect) and the role of altruism that can only be observed at the level of interactions between organisms within species. This alternative understanding of evolution, he suggested, was much more in line with Darwin’s original ideas.Andrew was born in Sedbergh, Cumbria, to Katharine (nee Johnston), a nurse, and Eric, a teacher who later became a vicar. He was educated at Gordonstoun, initially in Wales to where the school was evacuated during the second world war (and when his parents both were on the staff as chaplain and matron), and then in Scotland when the school returned north after the war ended. He completed national service in the navy and then studied zoology at Pembroke College, Oxford.Andrew’s first job was a lectureship in zoology at the University of New Zealand in Auckland. In 1959 he was invited to join the staff in Naples at the Stazione Zoologica. He then joined the University of Edinburgh in 1971, first as lecturer and later as reader in physiology, where students are said to have been “entranced” by his lectures. He took early retirement from Edinburgh in 1988, partly as a protest against education cuts and the beginnings of bureaucratic staff assessment regulations, and accepted a chair in zoology at the University of Naples, describing himself as a “refugee from Thatcher”.

This is a good reminder of the impact the border wall can have on wildlife movement, especially in emergency situations like this.”“[Fires are] just another thing to assess for impacts to wildlife from the border fence; just like flooding, some wildlife cannot escape,” wrote another FWS biologist.Among the animals killed in the fire were 100 frogs, most likely native Rio Grande leopard frogs, six cane toads, two shrews, six tarantula spiders, a yellow-billed cuckoo, a groove-billed ani cuckoo and a dozen snakes including Mexican racers, checkered garters and Texas patch-nosed serpents.

The increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, as part of the country’s green ambitions, also means there can be rapid shifts in the main source of electricity generation. On windy days, most electricity generation comes from onshore and offshore windfarms. When conditions are cold and still, gas-fired power stations known as peaking plants are called into action.The electricity system in Great Britain relies on a combination of “baseload” power – from stable generators such as nuclear and biomass plants – and “intermittent” sources, such as wind and solar farms that need the right weather conditions to feed energy into the grid. National Grid also imports energy from overseas, through subsea cables known as interconnectors that link to France, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. They allow companies to trade excess power, such as renewable energy created by the sun, wind and water, between different countries. By 2030 it is hoped that 90% of the energy imported by interconnectors will be from zero carbon energy sources.The technology behind Great Britain’s power generation has evolved significantly over the last century. The first integrated national grid in the world was formed in 1935 linking seven regions of the UK. In the aftermath of industrialisation, coal provided the vast majority of power, before oil began to play an increasingly important part in the 1950s. In 1956, the world’s first commercial nuclear reactor, Calder Hall 1 at Windscale (later Sellafield), was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Coal use fell significantly in the 1990s while the use of combined cycle gas turbines grew. Now a combination of gas, wind, nuclear and biomass provide the bulk of Great Britain’s energy, with smaller sources such as solar and hydroelectric power also used. From October 2024, coal will no longer be used to generate electricity.MethodologyThe charts visualise Great Britain’s electricity generation data. Northern Ireland has a separate energy market from the rest of the UK and is not included in the figures.",

Higher temperatures have also been linked to lower hatchling success rates.In a “doomsday scenario”, said study co-author Prof Graeme Hays, “there may be only females being produced from certain populations, which obviously would then lead to population extinction”.Previous research has linked warmer seas to overwhelmingly female green sea turtle populations in parts of the Great Barrier Reef. A 2018 study found that females accounted for 99.1% of juvenile turtles originating from nesting beaches in the north of the reef.Hays emphasised the new research wasn’t “all doom and gloom”, but highlighted the potential need for conservation strategies to cool the temperatures at nesting beaches.“There’s lots of good news going on around the world with sea turtles,” he said. “In a number of sites around the world, populations are going up; conservation is working really successfully.“With the climate warming feminisation [research], what we’re trying to do now is to get the information so that we can prevent problems down the line … [so] if turtles do need help down the track, we’re not caught off-guard.”Sea turtles tend to nest in the area they hatched from, a behaviour known as natal philopatry. It means, the researchers suggest, that they “cannot readily change their range to accommodate warming temperatures”.The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, used a projected 1.",

If something is not a real threat, birds will soon habituate to it – they learn it is not to be feared.”Goumas added that the use of falconry, as favoured in some settings, including Wimbledon, also had downsides. “Real predators can cause birds to flee, but these birds are flown for a short period of time, so the deterred birds will usually return.”Birds can get caught in badly fitted netting. Photograph: Kay Roxby/AlamyEven in situations where it was permitted to remove or kill birds – which Goumas emphasised was illegal except in very specific circumstances under licence – such interventions may not be a permanent fix as they did not prevent other birds from moving into the same area, while netting could also be problematic.",

This brings the total number of certified heat pumps installed across the country to more than 200,000.The industry’s accreditation body, the MCS, said there was a late surge in demand for heat pumps after the government increased the grants available through its boiler upgrade scheme from £5,000 for an air-source heat pump to £7,500 in October. Applications for the grant increased by 50% after the introduction of the higher rate, it said.However, the MCS Foundation, which oversees the body’s standards scheme, said the UK was still falling short in its goal to reduce its reliance on gas, which is considered a crucial step in meeting Britain’s legally binding climate targets.It added that the installation of heat pumps would have increase more than tenfold within the next four years to meet the government target of 600,000 a year by 2028.David Cowdrey, the director of external affairs at the foundation, said the industry would still need additional government policies, on top of the higher grants, to achieve “the exponential growth” that was “required now”.He called on the government to move social and environmental tariffs from energy bills into general taxation in order to reduce electricity costs and make running heat pumps substantially cheaper than a gas boiler.Charlotte Lee, the chief executive of the Heat Pump Association, a trade body, said: “With consumer demand for heat pumps rising, we encourage all heating engineers to look ahead and invest in heat pump installation training to support the anticipated deployment and to future-proof their business.”Solar installations fell short of the record 203,000 in 2011, when people rushed to take advantage of the amount they received from the feed-in-tariff support scheme before it was slashed.",

The guide’s latest edition, in October, awarded only one in eight UK fish the highest “green” status and considered only 13% a sustainable choice.Consumers should ask “what, where and how”, says Coombes – what species, where it was caught and how. A simple start, she suggests, would be to swap the “big five” for other seafood.Britons eat, on average, one serving of fish a week, 80% of which is made up of just five species. Cod and haddock, the staple of fish and chip dinners, is the most common choice, followed by salmon, tuna and prawns.A simple “swap” would reduce the pressure on this handful of preferred favourites, Coombes says, reducing the demand that drives unsustainable fishing and farming practices.Swap shop – what to buy instead of the big five1.",

It comes amid widespread concern about the environmental impact of carbon offsetting schemes, which have often been used to justify labelling products “carbon neutral”, or imply that consumers can fly, buy new clothes or eat certain foods without making the climate crisis worse.“This new legislation puts an end to misleading advertising for supposedly environmentally friendly products and thus enables consumers to make sustainable choices,” said Anna Cavazzini, the Green MEP and chair of the Committee of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.“I am particularly pleased that claims such as “climate-neutral” or “climate-positive”, which are based on CO2 offsetting, have been completely banned from the internal market. Investments by companies in climate protection projects are welcome and of course they can still be communicated,” she said. “However, it should no longer appear that planting trees in the rainforest makes the industrial production of a car, the organisation of a soccer World Cup or the production of cosmetics climate neutral.

The island has experienced other serious fires in recent years, with blazes in 2018 and 2021 razing hundreds of homes and causing the evacuation of thousands of residents and tourists.Experts say that wildfires in Hawaii are now burning through four times the amount of area than in previous decades, in part due to the proliferation of more flammable non-native grasses but also rising global temperatures.“We can say there are conditions that are consistent with wildfire, wildfire size and expansion that are changing as climate changes,” Erica Fleishman, a climate scientist at Oregon State University told CNN. “And some of the things that we’re seeing with this wildfire in Maui are consistent with some of the trends that are known and projected as climate changes.”Fires mapHawaii is experiencing increasingly dry conditions, with scientists calculating that 90% of the state is getting less rainfall than it did a century ago, with the period since 2008 particularly dry.The growing susceptibility of Hawaii to major fires was highlighted by a 2015 study that found that rainfall has been 31% lower in the wet season since 1990, in selected monitoring sites on the islands. The state, known for its volcanoes and lush forests, is in parts drying out as global heating continues to escalate.",

They argue that a “super rate of air passenger duty (APD)” should be applied to account for the damage caused to the planet. The CfBT also called on the government to strip private flights of their current VAT-free status.A glamorous and gilded New Year’s Eve to you: how UK’s wealthy can usher in 2023Read more“Private jets are hugely damaging to the environment and are the preserve of the super-rich,” said Norman Baker, the CfBT’s director of external affairs and a former Liberal Democrat MP.Currently, private jet passengers are charged the same rate of APD as business or first-class passengers, with a higher rate applied to aircraft of 20 tonnes or more with fewer than 19 passengers onboard.The campaigners said the new super rate of APD on private jet travel should be set at 10 times the current higher rate for domestic and European trips, which would apply to all private jet passengers, regardless of the size or capacity of the aircraft or distance travelled. They said the tax could raise £1.4bn-a-year – roughly equal to Network Rail’s entire annual maintenance costs.In addition, CfBT said the government should charge VAT each time a private jet lands or takes off, regardless of size or distance travelled, which would raise a further £79m-£623m.The number of private jets in operation rose by 7% last year and was up 47% on 2020, according to data from the private jet consultancy Wing-X.

Negotiations were set to continue on Monday, but plans were being drawn up for a minister to submit a statement to the Commons this week committing to change the existing planning rules.Once the rebels in question have secured the necessary guarantees, they would drop their amendment.Since 2015, an objection from a single resident can prevent a windfarm from being built. Councils can approve new sites only if they can show that local concerns have been “fully addressed”.According to government sources, the changes would allow councils to “more flexibly address the planning impacts of onshore wind projects as identified by local communities” and allow farms to be built “when it has been demonstrated that the planning impacts have been satisfactorily addressed”.The new guidance will stress that developers must “act on concerns and suggestions” from residents and that councils can only approve them where “there is community support”.",

The rail industry has warned the move could increase carbon emissions by 27,000 tonnes a year and result in 220,000 fewer rail journeys a year.Industry submissions obtained under freedom of information laws by openDemocracy reveal how the airlines lobbied for the duty cut to boost air travel in the UK, despite a drive to cut carbon emissions.Ryanair in its submission to the March 2021 consultation said it would be able to offer more domestic flights at low prices, pointing out that in Spain internal flights could be booked for as little as €5 (£4.42). The low-cost airline has unveiled a number of new UK domestic routes since the cut in duty was announced, including London Stansted to Cornwall.The airline also rejected a frequent flyer tax which would have progressively increased the fees for each flight taken. It argued it would be “likely only to punish passengers that have an ongoing practical requirement to fly frequently”.EasyJet said in its submission: “Our analysis shows that if domestic APD is reduced by 50%, this would support an overall 31% increase in domestic volume, to 10.6 million passengers.” BA’s owner, International Airlines Group, told the Treasury that “positive outcomes could include new routes, increased frequency and larger aircraft on existing routes as well as lower fares”.International flights will see an increase in duties from April. The duty for most economy long-haul flights from 2,000 to 5,500 miles will increase from £84 to £87. Economy flights of more than 5,500 miles will be subject to a duty of £91.",

There are people who have never done any gardening before but when they plant a seed or bulb, nurture it, see it sprout and grow, it has an enormously positive effect.”Among the speakers at the conference was Jonathan Aitken, the former Conservative cabinet minister who went to prison for perjury.

This is despite classification standards for bathing waters being made stricter in 2015, it claims.The announcement follows the publication last week of the government’s Plan for Water, which said water companies could face unlimited fines for dumping raw sewage in rivers, and outlined proposals that could see wet wipes containing plastic banned.Labour said the plan amounted to a rehash of old policies and claimed the measures would not stop sewage being dumped.The water minister, Rebecca Pow, said: “These popular swimming spots will now undergo regular monitoring, starting this May, so bathers have up-to-date information on the quality of the water. The regular monitoring also means that action can be taken if minimum standards aren’t being met.“We now have more bathing waters than ever, and we’ve worked hard in recent years to boost their status – with an incredible 93% now classed as good or excellent – and our new Plan for Water will help us go further and faster on our targets.”The Environment Agency will take regular samples at the newly designated sites during the bathing season, which runs from 15 May and 30 September.

This year’s Cop28, which begins on Thursday in Dubai, will be presided over by Sultan Al Jaber, the chief executive of the state oil company of the United Arab Emirates, which has the largest net-zero-busting expansion plans of any fossil fuel business in the world.It was already doubtful that Mr Al Jaber was fit to lead global climate negotiations while responsible for planet-wrecking activities. This week’s revelations that he planned to lobby on oil and gas deals during meetings with foreign governments ahead of Cop28 further damage his credibility as an honest broker in climate negotiations. Mr Al Jaber had a hard enough job without hustles making a mockery of his independence.Despite running the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Mr Al Jaber’s appointment as Cop28’s president-designate was welcomed by the US and the EU, and backed by the G77 bloc of developing countries. Fossil fuel lobbyists have campaigned to torpedo the global climate agenda. There is something to be said for forcing them into the open to account for their actions rather than letting them operate in the shadows.The world is not doing enough to prevent global temperatures increasing beyond the “safety” threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. At last year’s climate summit, nations agreed to reduce “inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”. But such state handouts worldwide reached a record high of $1.7tn in 2022, emphasising the conflict between Mr Al Jaber’s day job and his role at Cop28.In Dubai, there needs to be a shared zeal for achieving current climate targets, if not producing new, better ones. Mr Al Jaber must also seek agreement over further carbon cuts, payments for damage caused by global heating, and a fairer system of climate finance for poor nations, the majority of which comes as punitive high-cost loans.Bridging differences will be tricky.",

The pandemic, along with modern technology, has caused some of us to forget how to interact with others completely. See, for example, rising incidents of air rage.New York magazine has certainly noticed all this: the media outlet recently published a viral list of 140 rules of modern etiquette to help people navigate our brave new world. Unfortunately, a lot of the rules on the list were somewhat deranged and seemingly aimed at people who spend their days mingling with celebrities, attending “ironic birthday parties” and dropping in on gatherings where the hosts put out large bowls of cigarettes as party favours. In other words, not very useful for those of us who lead rather more mundane lives. So, you’ll be thrilled to know, I’ve helpfully put together my own list of rules for modern life that everybody should follow.First, visitor etiquette. If you arrive at someone’s house, what’s the polite way to let them know you’re there? While it seems like a straightforward enough question, customs vary wildly according to generation. People who grew up without phones often (shock horror!) knock or ring the doorbell. Millennials, meanwhile, will text to let you know they’ve arrived. I’m not entirely sure what Gen Z does – presumably they make a TikTok of themselves arriving. The correct option is to text. I’m not just saying that because I’m an elderly millennial; I’m saying it because hearing someone knocking on your door is objectively terrifying. That’s how a lot of horror movies start.Now for toilet paper orientation, another weirdly contentious issue. It should always hang over the top of the roll. If you are at someone’s house and they’ve made a terrible faux pas and hung it under the roll, then you are allowed to rearrange it for them. It’s only polite.Travel. Having recently sat in a middle seat for several hours I think we all need to get on board with the fact that sitting in the middle means you deserve both armrests – there should be no debate about this. Also, if you watch something on your phone without headphones on you should be put on the no-fly list.",

Six staff from the Foreign Office (FCDO) and four British Red Cross workers were at the airport to help travellers, he said.Other peers said unless the Foreign Office changed its travel advice, many Britons with holidays coming up would not be able to cancel them and receive refunds, at a time when budgets were strained amid the cost of living crisis.Courtown said: “The FCDO travel advice should not impact people’s ability to claim insurance for things like cancelled hotel bookings or flight changes, depending on their policy and level of cover.",

The trip was organised to publicise the government’s announcement of £200m to buy thousands of extra care home beds.The trip, which would have taken two-and-a-half hours by train, came even as the government pursues a policy of achieving net zero emissions by the UK domestic aviation sector.Downing Street defended Sunak’s choice of transport, saying: “The transport the prime minister takes will vary and will always be done in the interest of what is the most effective use of his time, enabling him to get around the entirety of the UK when there is a great deal of pressure on his time.”Labour, however, accused the prime minister of a “show of extravagance”. Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, said: “Patients and staff are crying out for action from this government in the midst of a crisis in our NHS while the prime minister jets from London to Leeds for a photo op.“The prime minister must come clean about how much taxpayers’ money was wasted on this 36-minute plane journey for a three-hour visit at the height of a cost of living crisis.”Sunak’s decision to travel by RAF jet emerged after Downing Street published a photograph of him boarding the aircraft on its Flickr page.He has been criticised before for flying short distances around the UK. Earlier this year, he personally paid more than £10,000 to fly by private helicopter from Battersea in London to a Tory dinner in Wales.The government did not say how much the flight cost, but SNP and Green MPs accused the prime minister of needlessly damaging the environment.Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “It is utterly indefensible for Tory ministers to make such short journeys by jet when far cheaper and much less damaging options are readily available.”SNP MP Tommy Sheppard tweeted that Sunak’s use of a jet made “a mockery of his climate pledges”.",

A passing cargo ship rescued the 20 crew onboard.The Philippine Coast Guard is deploying oil spill booms and absorbent booms to try to minimise damage, according to the environment department, which said it was “continuously assessing the important biodiversity sites”.Ram Temena, the disaster operations chief in the affected province of Oriental Mindoro, told Agence France-Presse an oil slick off Mindoro island, south of the capital, Manila, stretched for 120km (75 miles) and was about 9km (5.5 miles) offshore.Oriental Mindoro’s 18,000 registered fishers have been told to stay onshore until it was safe to fish, according to Agence France-Presse.Pola town in Oriental Mindoro, one of the worst affected areas, has been placed under a state of calamity due to the spill. The town’s mayor, Jennifer Cruz, told the Philippines media network GMA that the seawater and shoreline had turned black. “You can see the oil spill in the waves. Fish were dying. Our white sand is now black sand,” Cruz said.The environment department said this week that 21 marine protected areas could be affected, including seagrass beds, mangroves and pathways for fish larvae.Environmental campaigners are especially concerned about risks posed to the Verde Island Passage, a strait that separates the Philippine islands of Luzon and Mindoro, which has been described as the centre of global shore-fish biodiversity. It is also a source of food and livelihoods for more than 2 million people, according to Conservation International.Protect VIP, a coalition that seeks to protect the Verde Island Passage (VIP), has called on the government to expedite cleanup operations to minimise the damage, and for companies involved to be held accountable.",

Del Naja, also known as 3D, said Massive Attack hoped the gig would be a “proof of concept” to the music industry that low-carbon festivals are possible.The event, which will take place on 25 August 2024 on Clifton Downs, will be 100% powered by renewables. Every energy source will be battery or solar on the site, food vendors will be vetted to ensure they use locally sourced produce and a “climate-resilient woodland plantation in the south-west region” will be created after the show.The festival is the group’s latest intervention on the subject of touring and sustainability. In 2019, they teamed up with the University of Manchester’s Tyndall Centre to map the carbon footprint of tours, producing a “roadmap” for the industry that encouraged acts to reduce the amount of kit they brought with them and stop travelling by private jet.Festivals and groups have already made some changes, such as single-use plastic being banned from many sites. In 2000, Glastonbury began planting trees in the local environment, which absorb 800 tonnes of greenhouse gas a year and ensure the festival has a “net positive impact on the climate”. Morrissey has insisted on venues he plays being “meat free”, while Pearl Jam began offsetting their carbon emissions in 2003.But the Massive Attack event is targeting the biggest source of carbon emissions related to gigs: transport for the crowd itself.Mark Donne, a filmmaker and climate activist who has worked with Massive Attack on several projects, said 65% to 85% of emissions for large-scale shows comes from audience travel. He said it was something the industry did not want to face up to. “This will be the first show that meaningfully deals with that,” he said.",

It began forming on Saturday and gradually strengthened as it tracked north-east, passing between Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands on Tuesday as a category 1 equivalent storm.Bolaven subsequently underwent a process known as rapid intensification, with sustained wind speeds increasing from 90mph to 160mph (145km/h to 255km/h)– the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane – in just 12 hours. It continued to strengthen into Wednesday, reaching a peak intensity of sustained winds of 180mph, making it the second strongest storm of 2023, just shy of the 185mph achieved by Super Typhoon Mawar in May.The process of rapid intensification is defined as an increase in sustained winds of 35mph within 24 hours, a mark Bolaven easily surpassed, and it was not the only tropical storm to do so this week. Hurricane Lidia formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean last week and, despite an initially slow development, on Tuesday sustained winds increased by 65 mph in 24 hours. Lidia then ploughed into the west coast of Mexico as a category 4 storm, bringing sustained winds of 140mph, alongside heavy rain that resulted in landslides and some flash flooding.The phenomenon of rapid intensification is caused in part by very warm sea surface temperatures, with those in the western Pacific now trending around 1C-3C above average. As our climate continues to warm, we are likely to see more frequent examples of rapid intensification of tropical storms in future.While Lidia quickly dissipated as it moved inland, Bolaven is slowly weakening as it tracks north-west towards North America, where its remnants are expected to affect the weather next week as it interacts with the jet stream.Meanwhile, September was officially confirmed as the warmest on record by the Copernicus Climate Change Service.

He’s rehabilitated so many species, from warthogs to gerenuks, and he’s never lost an animal under his care. He has rescued even the most vulnerable, difficult creatures, such as Grévy’s zebra, which is a highly endangered species.Lekupania works in Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy in the far north of Kenya. The giraffe is an orphaned baby “reticulated giraffe” named Fupi, which means Shorty in Swahili. Fupi was injured when he fell into a ditch. He was rehabilitated and returned to the wild. And now all the rehabilitated giraffes come every morning to check on Lekupania. They do a round of the stables and greet him, then make their way back to the wild.This photo was taken in 2016, during a period of drought. Giraffes today are slowly and silently becoming extinct. Sometimes that’s due to poaching, but in this part of Kenya it’s mostly drought-related and from habitat loss. Current estimates suggest giraffe populations across Africa have dropped 40% in three decades, from around 155,000 in the late 1980s to less than 100,000 today. And there are fewer than 16,000 reticulated giraffes across Africa. West African and Rothschild’s giraffes are facing even more dire situations.The moment passed quickly: Fupi leaned in and that was itI only have a few frames of this moment. I was quite far away when I saw it. Trying not to scare the giraffe, I moved in quickly and quietly so that I could capture the intimacy between those two. The moment passed quickly: the giraffe leaned in and that was it.Photography was, for me, always about wanting to make sense of the world we live in.

Owners of the most polluting cars can expect to pay more than twice as much as cleaner cars. There are now 26 different charges to park for an hour in Lambeth, depending on a car’s tax band and whether there is a diesel surcharge. The cost of a parking bay near Waterloo station in south London now ranges between £6.30 and £13.23 an hour, with payment made by an app.The consultation on the charges introduced on 30 May included a new pricing structure for residents’ parking permits, which are already based on CO2 emissions. The annual cost of the highest band has risen from £340.73 to £500, with an additional annual surcharge of £140 for a diesel vehicle that does not comply with Euro 6 emission standards.Of more than 2,900 responses in the consultation, 59% objected to the proposals. Lambeth has implemented the changes despite opposition, stating that air quality is a major public health issue and a wide range of interventions is required.The drive to reduce car journeys and create what are known as 15-minute cities (in which key local facilities are within 15 minutes walk or cycle from someone’s home) has created divisions in many neighbourhoods.A small network of streets in Herne Hill in south London is one of the low-traffic schemes being piloted in Lambeth, which stops residential roads being used as “rat runs”, with wooden planters installed as barriers.Luke Cadden, 59, a handyman who pays for a residents’ parking permit for a Nissan Qashqai and opposes the road closures, said: “You can’t just keep increasing all the charges.

Fertiliser prices more than tripled, from £233 a tonne in 2020 to £766 a tonne in 2022, which farmers say led to a reduction in their use.Data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) published last week revealed that for key crops – wheat, barley, oilseed rape and sugar beet – fertiliser use decreased by an average of 27% compared with the 2010-19 average. Despite this, yields of those crops were 2.4% above average compared with the same period.An exception to the trend was the 10% increase in the use of fertilisers in the cultivation of potatoes, with a 8.6% reduction in yield.Fertiliser use in agriculture is a major cause of pollution. In 2022, Defra found that pressure from agriculture accounted for 40% of pollution in inland water bodies. They estimated that 50% of nitrate pollution, 25% of phosphorus in the water environment and 75% of sediment pollution came from agriculture.Martin Lines, the chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), a group of farmers who campaign for sustainability in the industry, said the data showed how reduced fertiliser usage “can bring big benefits to the business and beyond”.While the “alarming” price rises of fertiliser came as a “real shock” to farmers, Lines said, the minimal impact on yield was unsurprising. “We know that a lot of fertiliser applied to fields in the UK is not taken up by the crop, and instead gets washed into rivers and streams.”David Lord, an arable farmer based in Essex, described the move towards natural fertilisation methods as “definitely driven by economics”. He said he had reduced nitrogen usage by approximately 30% in the last decade, and believed that the recent gas crisis had forced farmers to become more environmentally efficient.“People are learning that using less fertiliser opens up the opportunity to try more nature-friendly methods,” Lord said. “Artificial fertilisers have a cost to us as growers, but also to the climate.",

Five years ago last week, Extinction Rebellion was launched in Parliament Square. Back then, a principal term of criticism lobbied at XR was that it was “alarmist”. Five years on, it’s plainly visible that it was not.In the past few months the process of climatic decline has dramatically accelerated, and we are exceeding many of the supposed worst-case scenarios laid out in climate models. We are plainly hurtling towards 1.5C of global over-heat, long before most seemingly well-informed people thought we would.And yet despite this, our climate protest movement in the UK today is nowhere near strong enough to force a change of course. XR’s “scare-mongering” over the existential threat facing us may have been decisively vindicated, but it was never able to recover its reputation from the Canning Town incident in October 2019, when rebels inexplicably stopped underground trains running – to much public criticism. Since then, it has struggled to assert itself as a credible vehicle for truly mass mobilisation.Many significant organisations and movements have emerged in its wake. The most attention-grabbing have been from the recent, even more radical flank of the UK’s climate movement – first Insulate Britain and then Just Stop Oil – who have blocked the M25, stopped test matches and much more. To me, these activists are obviously on the right side of history. But at the same time, many in the broader climate movement now feel that action that disrupts the general public has become counterproductive – as XR came to learn. Citizens already feel the alarm has been raised. Right now, they don’t need further reminders: they need a journey into positive, effective action that they feel includes them.",

Tackling it is a priority for Tory and Labour supporters, while half of all voters believe the government is not doing enough to get to net zero, according to polling by More In Common.The perception that “red wall” voters do not care about the issue is not backed up by the evidence. In fact, the opposite is true, with polls suggesting this group cares more deeply than others about the impact of rising temperatures on their families, jobs and country.“Blue wall” voters also believe that getting to net zero should be a priority, and adopting green technology such as electric vehicles and heat pumps is increasingly becoming part of their identity.“It would be a mistake for politicians to misinterpret the Uxbridge result and end up on the wrong side of public opinion,” said Luke Tryl, the director of More in Common. “Our polling and focus groups are clear. If the Conservative party were to deliberately tarnish its green credentials, it would risk further damaging the party’s prospects with the two voting blocs they most need to win back: voters in the blue and red wall.”Signals this week that Sunak could delay or abandon green policies that impose a direct cost on consumers could have a knock-on effect, undermining trust that the government will not suddenly do a U-turn on measures after people have already paid out.“Politicians dithering on climate risks being as dangerous to building consensus as outright opposition,” Tryl said.",

On Thursday, the snowpack in the southern Sierra was 436% of normal for this time of year, according to California’s department of water resources (DWR).“This year’s massive snowpack is posing continued flood risks in the San Joaquin Valley,” said the DWR director, Karla Nemeth, in a written statement, noting the bittersweet outcome of very wet winter after years of drought.The snowpack will lead to sustained high flows across the San Joaquin and Tulare basins over several months, Nemeth said.Widespread damage has already been done. The rapidly rising waters forced evacuations across the region in early spring, as communities rushed to higher ground. In Tulare county – one of the world’s largest milk-producing regions – thousands of cows were lost to the floods, while roughly 75,000 had to be trailered to safety.

But a muddy piece of land in west Somerset was unveiled with a fanfare on Wednesday by the conservation charity, which sees this unassuming-looking plot as a pioneering project that could revolutionise the way some rivers are managed.Under the stage-zero restoration project at the Holnicote estate, a section of the River Aller has been liberated from its narrow artificial channel. This allows the water to find its own way, creating streams, pools and boggy ground, a landscape that is better for flora and fauna. Moreover, the slower flow makes flooding less probable downstream.“It’s not neat and tidy. In fact, it’s a bit of a squelchy mess,” said the project manager, Ben Eardley, as he surveyed the spot. “Good-quality habitat is a patchy kind of mess, but within it, there is diversity – life.”The project, which is said to be a first in the UK and was inspired by schemes in the wilds of Oregon in the north-west of the United States, involves a three-quarters-of-a-mile stretch of the Aller being set free. More than 4,000 tonnes of earth was moved to fill the channel and 700 tonnes of fallen timber harvested from the estate was placed within the floodplain.The area before work began.

It was quite nervy.”But he said that six weeks on from the “river reset”, there had been spectacular results on the 27-hectare (66-acre) site. Fields previously dry and barren are now wet and vibrant.Eardley said almost instantly, hundreds of swallows and house martins arrived to feast upon the insects that the scheme encouraged; white egrets have been spotted and buzzards and kestrels soar and hover above the site.A rapid increase in the number of bats has been noted, and dragonflies skim over the water.

The group, which is made up of dozens of international climate and anti-disinformation organizations including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, released the report to draw attention towards climate misinformation on major platforms and makes the claim that big tech has become a “complicit actor” in accelerating the spread of climate denial.Elon Musk says Twitter, now X, could charge all users subscription feesRead moreTwitter’s rank in the survey was because it failed to meet almost any of the organization’s criteria for climate misinformation policies, which ranged from having clear and publicly available information on climate science to having clearly articulated policies on what actions the company will take against the spread of misinformation. The report noted that billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk’s purchase of the company last year added to the confusion over how policies are enforced and how the company makes content decisions.“Elon Musk’s acquisition of the company has created uncertainty about which policies are still standing and which are not,” the report stated.Twitter received its only point in the report for fulfilling one of the researchers’ requirements that platforms have an easily accessible and readable privacy policy. Twitter was also the only platform to lack a clear reporting process for flagging harmful or misleading content for higher review.Tech platforms have long struggled with creating effective or coherent policies on content moderation, while events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election resulted in swaths of misinformation circulating online. Amid conservative backlash and labor cuts in the tech industry, many companies have also deprioritized content moderation and opened the door to potential surges in misinformation on their platforms.",

Last month, the regulator began legal proceedings against operator Newcrest, alleging the mine had breached clean air regulations.Wright told a NSW upper house inquiry into the current and potential impacts of gold, silver, lead and zinc mining on human and environmental health on Monday that he believed the water sampling methods used by regulators this year to check residential rainwater supplies were “not fit for purpose”.Cadia goldmine: EPA begins court proceedings over alleged breach of clean air regulationsRead moreHe conducted a previous tank sampling program for the Cadia Community Sustainability Network (CCSN), which reported in March that a third of the samples were above the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines for lead, which is 10 micrograms per litre.Testing of residential rainwater tanks has since been carried out by the EPA, NSW Health, and by an independent company on behalf of Newcrest. The NSW Health samples, taken from kitchen taps, were all within guideline levels. Tap samples taken by the EPA and by ALS on behalf of Newcrest reported some results outside guideline levels, and EPA samples from the top of tanks found 14 tanks with elevated levels of lead.Wright told the inquiry that he took 30 water samples from 10 residential properties near the goldmine, with the aid of CCSN, on 30 and 31 August, collecting from the kitchen tap, the top of the tank, and the bottom of the tank. Samples from the tap and the top of the tank were within guideline levels.From the bottom of the tank, “all 10 samples received results showing lead at concentrations above the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines,” Wright said. “One tank sample exceeded the guideline by 6.6 times, one by 110 times and one by 140 times.",

The presence of so-called “watermelon snow” – an unofficial moniker due to its pinkish tint – is piquing the curiosities of photo-seeking visitors and raising a host of questions about nature, health and climate. Its prevalence this summer is particularly striking on ridges and in mountain ranges where snow would have melted by now in drier years.The Technicolor snow appears in high-altitude environments throughout the globe including the French Alps and Japan’s Mountains of Dewa when a perfect storm of conditions – water content, sunlight, temperatures and the presence of nutrients – awaken dormant green algae called Chlamydomonas nivalis that thrive in cold temperatures. The algae swim to the surface of the snow, where they bloom and divide. Upon arrival, when they are hit by sun and ultraviolet rays, their color changes to absorb radiation and protect themselves from damage.Scott Hotaling, a Utah State University ecologist who studies biodiversity in cold and high-altitude environments, likened the algae’s ability to produce a secondary pigment to humans, whose skin uses pigmentation to absorb ultraviolet radiation and protect from the sun.“They need some kind of pigmentation to prevent damage related to the high-UV of the environment they’re in. So they produce the secondary pigment largely for that purpose to protect themselves,” he said.",

They either have to admit certain wrongdoing or they run the risk of lying under oath. If I were them, I would come in with more of a mea culpa approach and acknowledge what they’ve done wrong,” he said.“It’ll be a turning point for them. It could be the big tobacco moment. We’ve never had a situation where the big oil executives have to answer under oath for their company’s behaviour.”Khanna said that he wanted Americans to take away the message from the hearing that the oil companies “knew they lied” about the climate emergency.The CEOs, who have opted to testify by video, are Darren Woods of Exxon, David Lawler of BP American, Michael Wirth of Chevron and the president of Shell, Gretchen Watkins.The leaders of two powerful lobby groups accused of acting as front organisations for big oil, the American Petroleum Institute and the US Chamber of Commerce, will also testify.Khanna said the oil chiefs will be confronted with evidence of a persistent and coordinated cover-up, including documents that have not been made public before.",

That move, reportedly costing almost $1bn, secured 422 megawatts of solar capacity with a further 765MW expansion possible.A decision to proceed on that additional capacity including storage would probably be made by the first quarter of 2024, said Low Kian Min, Gentari’s chief renewables officer. Developments would be in solar, wind and batteries and could be through the company’s own investments, joint ventures or further purchases.Investment in new Australian wind and solar farms stalls amid ‘raft of barriers’, report findsRead more“The target for us is obviously to grow this market into a much larger one,” Low said in Sydney on Tuesday. “Our internal targets are [to have] between five and eight gigawatts of installed capacity by 2030.”Australia’s well-publicised challenges of getting new renewables from the planning stage to operation – including a recent stalling of new projects winning investment approval – were not a deterrent to Gentari.“All countries have challenges,” Low said. “It is quite fundamental for us that we actually get buy-in from the local stakeholders [when] we access their land and … build our investments.”Initially, Gentari’s focus will be the eastern states that make up the national electricity market. It is also considering projects in Western Australia, particularly batteries coupled with solar, said Andrew Barson, the chief executive of Gentari Solar Australia.Barson will oversee the Maryvale solar and energy storage project in New South Wales and the similar Barnawartha project in Victoria. Both are expected to reach final investment approval soon with a combined capacity of more than 500MW.Gentari, which operates renewable plants in Malaysia and India, sees its renewable projects in Australia as a “first flag”, Low said.

He is making the UK a climate villain and destroying its international reputation as a climate leader. These policies are destructive for the planet, which is already boiling, and they will be negative for the UK’s economy.”He added: “While the US, the EU and China engage in a race to become leaders in clean technology, these decisions will scare off investors from modernising the UK’s industry.”Peter Liese, a German MEP with the centre-right group, said: “Great Britain is gambling with its pioneering role in international climate policy and risks confusing market participants on important technologies.”He added: “My group and I have always opposed the ban on combustion engines, and I also take a critical view of the ban on individual heaters. But if you set out on the road and then fail to come up with alternative proposals when these measures are abolished, that’s problematic.”But a senior diplomat from eastern Europe said the developments seemed to “follow the trend on the continent”.In recent months, the EU’s top climate envoy, Frans Timmermans, has left Brussels to run in the upcoming Dutch elections, the centre-right grouping in the European parliament has taken a tougher line on green policies, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the European Green Deal is entering its “next phase”.",

Technological advancements mean Australia’s underwater cultural heritage is more vulnerable than ever, the committee heard.The treaties committee released its report on Monday afternoon, recommending Australia ratify the UN convention on the protection of underwater cultural heritage. Australia helped draft the 2001 convention, and is a signatory to it, but has not yet ratified it and so is not bound by it.As ‘metal pirates’ loot seabed treasures, there are fears Australia’s first submarine could be nextRead moreAustralia has about 8,000 underwater cultural heritage sites, which are mostly shipwrecks, but can include plane wrecks, cargo and other significant sites.Such sites have some protection under existing laws and the UN convention on the law of the sea, but ratifying the protection of underwater cultural heritage convention would better protect heritage that has been underwater for at least 100 years. It would harmonise and clarify existing laws and would allow Australia to encourage and support other nations in the region to sign up.The assistant director of underwater cultural heritage at the federal environment department, Dr Andrew Viduka, said ratifying the convention would enable Australia to “join and participate in the global community’s response to the looting and destruction of underwater cultural heritage”.“It will enable Australia to assist in stopping the trafficking of stolen underwater cultural heritage artefacts or their movement through Australia,” he said.“Looting of sites has the impact of not only removing artefacts and damaging the site but of disturbing or destroying the associated context of objects between each other. The looting of sites is akin to removing chapters from our history, with the loss never to be replaced and the story never to be told.",

It just seems such a paradox.”Dolphins ‘shout’ to compensate for human-made background noiseRead moreA central puzzle was how whales manage to generate sufficient flow of air, given that at 1,000 metres below the surface the pressure is so great that the air in the whale’s lungs is crushed to 1% of the volume it would occupy at the surface.The latest work shows that as whales dive deep below the surface, their lungs collapse and air is compressed into a small muscular pouch inside the mouth.To make a click, the whale opens a valve on the pouch for about a millisecond causing a high pressure blast of air to pass through a vibrating structure in the nose, called the phonic lips. “When the lips slap back together, that’s what makes the click,” said Madsen. The clicks, used to navigate and hunt prey, can reach volumes equivalent to a very powerful rifle being fired.The study, carried out over a decade, used high-speed video recorded through endoscopes, and collected audio recordings, using electronic tags, from trained dolphins and porpoises, and sperm whales and false killer whales in the wild.

This adjustment raises baseline emissions. Post-Covid car demand has been lowered by 5% to reflect lower levels of commuting. However, the Department for Transport forecasts that HGV and van miles will be higher than that forecast … due to outturn data showing higher van and HGV traffic than previously assumed.”Campaigners also criticised a new policy by the DfT which requires decision-makers to ignore the negative climate impact of road-building and traffic but to give weight to tree planting around schemes as a nature-based solution to climate change. It says an increase in emissions from road schemes is “not a reason to prohibit” their approval.There are 32m cars on the UK’s roads, and they are growing in number and size. Transport is the country’s largest emitting sector and produced 24% of the UK’s total emissions in 2020.Chris Todd, the director of campaign group Transport Action Network, said: “The DfT claims this new policy will ensure transport projects ‘meet environmental targets’. Yet it states that an increase in emissions from road schemes is not ‘reason to prohibit’ or restrict their approval.“With the revised net zero strategy admitting we are off track to meet 2030 targets, ministers are deliberately accelerating us towards runaway climate change. We need the public to tell them to slam the brakes on this road-building spree. Instead, we urgently need world-class public transport and active travel, not world-destroying temperature rises.”Friends of the Earth’s head of policy, Mike Childs, said: “For far too long transport policy has been dominated by motoring and road building, with its consequential and largely ignored impact on climate change and air pollution.“Britain’s transport system needs a change of direction with priority given to better public transport and cycling infrastructure instead of more motoring.",

After 2,000 years of keeping one another at paw’s length, wildcats and their domestic cousins began to interbreed about 60 years ago, a new study suggests.Doing so may have helped to protect their offspring against diseases harboured by domestic cats, but this interbreeding is now threatening the survival of wildcats as a distinct species.Domestic cats are generally considered to have descended from Near Eastern wildcats that prowled the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East back when early human farmers began storing grain. They arrived in Britain – where European wildcats also lived – about 2,200 years ago.Today, hybridisation between wild and domestic cats is pushing the Scottish wildcat population to the brink of extinction, because the genes that define them are being “swamped” by those from hybrid and domestic cats.“Not only are we at risk of losing a species from Britain, we’re potentially replacing it with hybrid and feral domestic cats that may be not as well adapted and may not perform the same ecological role in their habitat,” said Jo Howard-McCombe of the University of Bristol and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS).“It is important to understand the history of this process, so that we can be better informed to manage that threat into the future.”To investigate when this interbreeding started, Howard-McCombe and her colleagues analysed genomic sequences from wild and domestic cats, including 48 modern felines and 258 ancient samples excavated from 85 archaeological sites over the last 8,500 years.The results, published in Current Biology, suggested that these creatures broadly avoided sexual contact with one another until the late 1950s, when rates of interbreeding between wild and domestic cats in Scotland rose rapidly – possibly as a result of dwindling wildcat populations.“If you have a population of wildcats that’s being completely eradicated, those that are left are going to want to mate with something, and if the only thing that’s around are domestic cats, that’s probably what they’re going to choose,” said Prof Greger Larson at the University of Oxford, who contributed to the research.",

Another of its reservoirs, Colliford in Cornwall, is at 60% of capacity, compared with 79% at this time last year.The water firm said last summer was exceptionally dry and hot, with one of the driest periods in the south-west in more than 130 years, and the hottest temperatures ever recorded in the south-west.The company said: “Our water resources across the region remain under pressure and as we go into the summer period we have taken the necessary action to safeguard supplies and break the cycle of drought following lower than average levels of rainfall last year and throughout February.“The temporary use ban now applies to customers in the Roadford supply area and came into force on 25 April 2023.

The company said it hoped the ban would be lifted on 1 December – or sooner if enough rain falls before then.Customers were told they would not receive a discount since they were charged for water use for the purposes of drinking, washing, sanitation and central heating – not for non-essential purposes such as watering the garden.",

Now, they are “seriously threatened with extinction”, according to the Washington fish and wildlife commission (FWS).A nine-member panel voted unanimously last week to adopt a recommendation from the agency’s conservation assessment manager, Taylor Cotten, to reclassify western gray squirrels for the first time since they were placed on the threatened species list in 1993.“Some species come and go, and the problem with so many species right now is the pace at which we are losing them,” commissioner Tim Ragen said during a public meeting earlier this month.“One of the distinctions we want to draw is whether or not they’re coming and going due to natural factors versus human-related factors. This one is a case where human-related factors are clearly involved.”The squirrels have moderate to high sensitivity to climate change that degrades the quality of their habitat, the agency says, and disease outbreaks “could become more frequent with warmer temperatures”.Almost 56,000 acres of land under the jurisdiction of the state’s department of natural resources were burned in hundreds of wildfires in Washington last year. Notably, “the frequency and severity of wildfires [is] increasing with climate change”, Cotten told CBS News.He told the commission that a state recovery plan implemented in 2007, including voluntary preservation guidelines for landowners intended to protect ponderosa pine and Douglas fir trees that the squirrels prefer, had failed to arrest the species’ decline, or dissuade development.“On their own, they’re not doing the job we hoped they’d do,” he said. “We’re still seeing habitat loss at 20%, even with these actions.”Melanie Rowland, another commissioner, said successive studies had shown squirrel numbers plummeting as more trees were felled.“There’s no good news in that at all.",

The peer said in a letter to supporters of the Atlantic Salmon Trust, which he chaired: “Difficulties do remain with a lack of understanding of the impact of predation by increasing numbers of fish-eating birds and a burgeoning seal population – all enjoying protection by law.”Experts disagree that shooting seals protects salmon. Hugo Tagholm, executive director of Oceana UK, said overfishing, salmon farming and poor water quality are drivers of salmon decline, not seals which evolved alongside salmon: “It is these issues we should be focused on, not shooting our seals. The UK can be proud of the fact that it is home to internationally important populations of seals. But they need our protection: since they are slow to reproduce and vulnerable to the climate crisis and disease, any increase in adult mortality can quickly affect a population, destroying a keystone species of our rich marine wildlife.”Douglas-Miller was made a baron on Friday in a surprise appointment as an environment minister and given the portfolio responsibility for animal welfare this week.In September, he signed a letter with fellow grouse moor owners lobbying the Scottish government to water down new laws that bring in licences for grouse-shooting in an effort to address persecution of birds of prey.Scotland is a stronghold for the grey seal and thousands of tourists travel to see them and their fuzzy, white young.",

Animal Equality described the decision as “mind-bogglingly irresponsible”.A legal letter, sent to Gove and NELC by the law firm Advocates for Animals on behalf of the charity, says: “Due to the scale of the project, the uniqueness of it, the location and risks to the local wildlife, the impact of any malfunction, or indeed any unforeseen circumstances, has the potential to be huge and complex. In-depth assessment and clarity is especially important for such a new enterprise, where the impacts remain unknown, anything less will be purely speculative.”The letter says that there are significant risks from water being pumped from the Humber estuary – which is designated as a “wetland of international importance” under the Ramsar convention – then pumped back in after it has been used by the farm to house the fish, as well as from contamination to the surrounding area and wildlife from diseased fish. Official figures suggest that salmon mortality on Scottish farms hit record levels this year.",

Puffins were close to extinction, with just 13 counted on the windswept 450-hectare island in 2001.Seabirds treble on Lundy after island is declared rat-freeRead moreBut a drive to remove rats from the island has helped numbers to rebound. Black and brown rats, which arrived on Lundy as stowaways on ships over many decades, had been preying on the eggs and chicks, particularly those of burrow-nesting shearwaters and puffins.The rats were eradicated in a partnership led by the RSPB, Natural England, the Landmark Trust and the National Trust between 2002 and 2004 – a move that was opposed at the time by some animal rights groups, who argued that conservationists were favouring tourist-friendly birds over the rats.Since the island was declared rat-free in 2006, its seabird populations have bounced back, as they have on other small islands when invasive predators let loose by humans have been removed.Paul St Pierre, a conservation officer for the RSPB, said: “Partnership projects like this show just how much potential there is to restore species and landscapes on an incredible scale.“If we can restore over 30,000 birds to one small island in the Bristol Channel, just imagine how much could be achieved if everyone came together to restore nature right across the UK.”Manx shearwaters taking off near Lundy.

He had a detailed knowledge of the wildlife of Shropshire and was eager to learn about other environments through observation and reading. He was a member of the Shropshire Wildlife Trust council from 1976, served as trust president from 1988 to 1993 and remained a vice-president until recently.In the 1970s, Paul started the task of rewilding the four-acre field at our family home near Betton Moss – a pioneering conservation initiative back then and one which he continued working on until his death. This enhanced local biodiversity, resulting in the return of barn owls and increases in other birds, mammals and invertebrates, such as land snails and butterflies, including brimstones. He added ponds and erected nest boxes and refuges of all sizes, for birds and for bats, native bees and small mammals. He also designed and planted a small wood there.Through his presentations to groups, photographs and writings, he aimed to influence others. He championed conservation-focused land use as an alternative to formal country gardens or high-intensity farming. Paul co-authored a chapter on the Shropshire Wildlife Trust in Wildlife in Trust, a book published in 2012 to celebrate 100 years of nature conservation in the UK and he had a monthly column, Country Comment, in the local newspaper for 34 years.Paul and his twin brother, Ben, were born in Penkhull, Staffordshire, the sons of Benjamin Bell, managing director of Brittains paper mill, and his wife, Elsie (nee Moores).",

By comparison, humanity now weighs in at a total of around 390m tonnes.At the same time, the species we have domesticated, such as sheep and cattle, in addition to other hangers-on such as urban rodents, add a further 630m tonnes to the total mass of creatures that are now competing with wild mammals for Earth’s resources. The biomass of pigs alone is nearly double that of all wild land mammals.The figures demonstrate starkly that humanity’s transformation of the planet’s wildernesses and natural habitats into a vast global plantation is now well under way – with devastating consequences for its wild creatures. As the study authors emphasise, the idea that Earth is a planet that still possesses great plains and jungles that are teeming with wild animals is now seriously out of kilter with reality. The natural world and its wild animals are vanishing as humanity’s population of almost eight billion individuals continues to grow.Fin whales feeding off the Gulf of California. The species was found by the study to have the highest biomass of ocean creatures.

These creatures are not doing well at all. Their total mass is around 22m tonnes which is less than 10% of humanity’s combined weight and amounts to only about 6lb of wild land mammal per person. And when you add all our cattle, sheep and other livestock, that adds another 630m tonnes. That is 30 times the total for wild animals. It is staggering. This is a wake-up call to humanity.",

Governments in Sweden and Britain have faced heavy criticism for backtracking on green pledges, and on Tuesday Ursula von der Leyen, the EU Commission president, welcomed a deal by EU governments to water down rules on vehicle emissions.“Europe is facing a make-or-break moment in terms of whether it is willing to pay the costs – both financial and political – of moving forward with the next phase of decarbonisation at the speed and according to the model it has set out in the European green deal,” write authors Susi Dennison, an ECFR senior policy fellow, and analyst and writer Mats Engström.To make the case for decarbonisation, the report recommends that policymakers should focus on energy sovereignty and how the green industrial transformation can help make their countries more economically competitive. It also suggests focusing on how EU financial support can contribute to a fair transition, along with the risks of the climate crisis.“The EU stands to benefit from being a global green leader, but it needs to rapidly adapt its policy instruments to the changed geopolitical circumstances,” the report added.While public support for action on the climate remains high across the continent, uncertainty about energy prices and supply means it is increasingly facing cost and competitiveness challenges.Before the European parliament elections in June, Poland, Slovakia, the Netherlands and Austria have elections, as well as potentially Croatia and Romania.Meanwhile, the report warns that Italy, Sweden, Finland and Greece all have governments that include or depend on forces that “explicitly prioritise national interests and are more wary of what they perceive as an internationalist agenda”.",

The current figure surpasses the record of 22 such events set in 2020.Greek PM under attack over handling of Storm Daniel disaster responseRead moreSo far, the total cost of disasters in 2023 is more than $57.6bn, according to Noaa.The record figure does not include major disasters such Tropical Storm Hilary last month, as the cost of damage is still being totaled, Adam Smith, the Noaa applied climatologist and economist who tracks the billion-dollar disasters, told the Associated Press. Hilary brought life-threatening flooding and rainfall to the US south-west, leaving thousands of people without power.Smith said the increase in expensive weather events was caused by a rise in the number of natural disasters and more communities being built in risk-prone locations.“Exposure plus vulnerability plus climate change is supercharging more of these into billion-dollar disasters,” Smith said.Eight new billion-dollar disasters were added to the list in an update last month. The Hawaii wildfires that killed at least 115 people on Maui were added, with damages there projected to cost upwards of $5.5bn. Hurricane Idalia also caused more than $1bn in damage, as the category 3 hurricane devastated Florida at the end of August.Other events listed by Noaa included severe summer weather, including a Minnesota hailstorm and storms in the north-east, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.“This year a lot of the action has been across the center states, north central, south and south-eastern states,” Smith.Experts have long pointed out that climate disasters and extreme weather create exceptionally large costs for local governments.Last week, more than 60 million Americans were under heat alerts, an extreme weather event that cities have struggled to allocate funding towards.Experts say the US has to do more to adapt to increased disasters as they are only projected to get worse.",

In the US it is one in 16 men and one in 17 women.The US study found that more frequent use of indoor wood heating led to greater risk. For example, people who used their wood burner on more than 30 days a year had a 68% increased lung cancer risk compared with people who did not burn wood.The results come from the Sister Study, which tracks the health of 50,000 US women who had sisters with breast cancer.Dr Suril Mehta, from the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and first author of the new study, said: “The Sister Study was designed to better understand genetic and environmental risk factors for breast cancer, but it is also equipped to evaluate other health outcomes in women. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among US women. It accounts for roughly one in five cancer-related deaths in the US.”Globally, tobacco smoking is the biggest risk factor for lung cancer, but not the only one. This was reflected in the Sister Study findings. The latest results come after tracking the women’s health for an average of 11 years. During this time 347 participants were diagnosed with lung cancer; 289 were current or former tobacco smokers and 58 were non-smokers.Having allowed for income and other factors that could have affected the women’s health there were clear differences in the risk of developing lung cancer in those that heated their homes with wood compared with those that did not. This extra risk was seen in both tobacco smokers and those who had never smoked.In the UK, only 4% of homes that use solid fuel rely on it as their only heating source. Similarly, the Sister Study homes primarily used gas or electricity for heating, with wood being mainly a secondary or tertiary heating source.",

It is a dangerous toxic chemical and proposing to ban it will protect families, workers and communities,” said the EPA deputy administrator, Janet McCabe.TCE, or trichloroethylene, is a volatile organic compound that humans are frequently exposed to in a variety of settings, though those who use products with the chemical in an occupational setting are most at risk. It’s also commonly used in carpet cleaning treatments, hoof polishes, brake cleaners, pepper spray and lubricants.Among other health issues, the chemical is thought to be a carcinogen and a liver toxin, harm male reproduction, cause neurological damage, damage kidneys and cause Parkinson’s disease.Officials suspect TCE water contamination is behind multiple cancer clusters, and the compound is one a range of chemicals polluting military base drinking water that is suspected of sickening and killing service members at bases across the US. Areas in the US with the highest TCE contamination levels have been designated Superfund sites, which is reserved for the nation’s most polluted locations.Recent EPA research found that as much as 250m pounds of TCE are still produced in the US annually, and much of that ends up in the water.Efforts to ban the chemical date back 40 years. The Obama administration proposed strong limits on its use in 2016, but the Trump administration undid those and in effect suspended the process. The Biden administration is going even further than the Obama EPA by proposing an outright ban, a step the agency rarely takes when regulating toxic chemicals.Public health advocates have pressed for prohibition since the 2016 passage of legislation that expanded the EPA’s authority over toxic chemicals and made it easier to outlaw them.",

It includes a ban on single-use plastic cutlery and plates, cotton buds, expanded polystyrene cups and plastic straws, as well as cutting back on plastic food packaging.The law conforms to a European Union directive limiting the use of single-use plastics and which aims to oblige polluters to clean up the mess they create.Cigarette manufacturers will also be responsible for educating the public not to discard their butts in the public space but it remains unclear how the clean-up will be implemented or what it will cost.New Zealand passes world-first tobacco law to ban smoking for next generationRead moreOne Catalan study put the cost at between €12-€21 per citizen per annum, a total of up to €1bn (£880m).Earlier this year, the Catalan government proposed introducing a scheme whereby cigarette butts could be redeemed for €0.20 each, which would add €4 to the current average price of €5 for a pack of 20. The scheme has not yet been introduced.It is assumed that the tobacco companies will pass on the cost to the consumer, providing one more incentive to quit the habit.

A survey by the family medicine association found that 85% favour further restrictions, with 72% backing a ban on smoking on the terraces of bars and restaurants.Cigarette ends are one of the most ubiquitous forms of litter and take about 10 years to decompose, in the process emitting toxic substances such as arsenic and lead.According to the Ocean Conservancy NGO, cigarette butts are the most common form of marine pollution, more even than plastic bags and bottles, with an estimated 5bn discarded in the ocean.",

That means possibly 1.1bn plates and 4.25bn items of cutlery in England will no longer be made each year.That sounds impressive, as if the environment secretary is getting on top of the plastics that are used only once but last for centuries, breaking down into innumerable tiny pieces and polluting rivers and seas in the process. But the new ban barely scratches the surface of a problem that has been known about for decades and is now out of control.Not only has Coffey been shamed into taking action by the Scottish and Welsh governments, which both moved last year on plastic waste, but the English ban mysteriously appears to apply only to plastic used in takeaway outlets and not in supermarkets or shops.There are few pollutants more insidious – or urgent to tackle – than plastic. Micro-plastics extend from ocean trenches to mountain tops. Plastic is found in human bodies and the food we eat, and it literally rains down on people and animals. But the ban is too narrow in its scope. It won’t cover single-use plastic water bottles, makes no mention of plastic bags and does not even try to control the burning of plastic waste in incinerators. There is still no deposit return scheme for drinks containers and no crackdown on the export of plastic waste to poorer countries.“A plastic fork can take 200 years to decompose,” trumpeted Coffey when announcing the ban. Yet by the time the new law is passed, it will have taken about 18 months of consultation, numerous environment secretaries and immense public pressure just to achieve this minimal advance. At this rate it will take more than 200 years to stop plastic pollution altogether.Clearly the government has little intention of acting comprehensively anytime soon. There is no financial incentive for catering or fast-food companies to switch out of single-use plastic and nothing to encourage the catering industry or households to recycle more.",

She noted concerning levels of microplastics have been found in sport fish consumed by humans and beer brewed with Great Lakes water.But the consequences for human health are unknown, Hataley said.“We know we are being exposed, but what that means in terms of harm or what’s a safe level – we have no idea, and that’s going to take more research,” she said.Getting a handle on the question starts with the US and Canadian governments coordinating the monitoring of microplastic levels, she added, and the nations’ Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement already has in place monitoring programs for other pollutants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

About 3m tonnes of agricultural pesticides are used globally each year.The research identified that 82% of pesticides degraded into other molecules while 10% remained as residues in the soil. Another 7.2%, about 68,000 tonnes, leached into aquifers – rocks or sediment that hold groundwater.“In many observed cases pesticide active substances may degrade into a cascade of daughter substances which can be as toxic as the parent and occasionally even more persistent [in the environment],” the scientists noted.The researchers estimated that 730 tonnes wound up in river systems each year, of which 710 tonnes made it to the world’s oceans.The latter figure comprised only a tiny fraction – less than 0.1% – of the agricultural pesticides used in the studied catchments.“Although this amount is less than 0.1% of net inputs, it is a cause of decreased species richness of stream invertebrates with little known consequences on near-coast ecosystems,” the researchers noted.The US banned a brain harming pesticide on food. Why has it slowed a global ban?Read moreThe study’s lead author, associate professor Federico Maggi of the University of Sydney, said even small amounts resulted in concentrations above safety limits.",

It’s not a particularly safe route, with many sections where Hipkins would be riding right alongside 100kmh traffic. It’s this kind of danger that stops cycle commuting from being particularly mainstream – just 2% commuted by bike at the last census – but this is far from a political priority for Hipkins. He loves to cycle, but the main thing he wants to do is win.This intense drive towards victory is crucial to understanding why Hipkins has spent the last month ditching many sections of his government’s climate change policy, all in the aftermath of two major storms which were likely worse because of climate change. It explains why a government that happily tells other nations to stop subsidising fossil fuels is once again extending a tax cut on petrol and diesel. It’s why Hipkins on Monday ditched not just expensive climate policies like the “cash for clunkers” scrappage scheme, but also the drive to lower speed limits in many parts of the country to increase road safety.We can’t afford to choose adaptation over cutting emissions – suggesting otherwise is dangerous | James ShawRead moreIt’s not that the government couldn’t lower speeds and fix storm-damaged roads at the same time – our transport agency has around 2,400 staff – it’s that Hipkins doesn’t want to talk about lowering the speed limit. He doesn’t want to talk about spending a small amount of money on bike lanes or a media merger or votes for 16-year-olds, and he doesn’t want the media talking about it either. The money is immaterial; the conversation is not.

Most of the islands rest just a few feet above sea level.Second, they consist of limestone, the Swiss cheese of geology, which is extremely permeable and porous.

However, the consultation has been delayed amid growing controversy over the government’s links to the housebuilding sector.The consultation was originally expected in March, before it was delayed to the summer and then scheduled for the end of the year. The plans will be finalised by next March.Green groups claim that the government has allowed housebuilders to save billions of pounds by delaying the new standards, which are expected to increase construction costs. In October, the Guardian revealed that at least 10% of donations received by the Conservative party since 2010 – about £40m – came from property developers, real estate tycoons and others connected with the construction industry.David Cowdrey, a director at the MCS Foundation, which accredits home energy installers, said: “Making heat pumps the default heating source for all new homes and banning gas and hydrogen boilers is absolutely the right step for the climate and for households’ energy bills.“Allowing fossil fuel or hydrogen heating in new homes would have locked in high bills and high carbon emissions for a generation. It is a huge relief that we are escaping that possibility and that the government has recognised the conclusive evidence that heat pumps and heat networks are the only viable option for getting our homes to net zero and ensuring low bills for people in new-build homes.",

The most toxic form of dioxin is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin or TCDD. TCDD is more commonly recognized as the toxic contaminant found in Agent Orange and at Love Canal, New York and Times Beach, Missouri, both sites of two of the most tragic environmental catastrophes in US history.Dioxin is not deliberately manufactured. It is the unintended byproduct of industrial processes that use or burn chlorine. It is also produced when chemicals such as vinyl chloride are burned such as occurred in East Palestine.The organization I work for, the Center for Health, Environment & Justice, has worked with communities affected by dioxins for over 40 years. We have seen the impact of exposure to dioxins in communities from Love Canal and Times Beach to Pensacola, Florida. And now, we are asking, why isn’t EPA testing for dioxins in East Palestine, Ohio? Are dioxins present in the soil downwind from the site of the accident?At a townhall meeting in East Palestine last week, people talked about what it was like when the black cloud reached their property. One person who lived 15 miles away described burned ash material from the fire that settled on her property. Another who lived 3 miles away described how the black cloud completely smothered his property. Repeatedly people asked: was it safe for my kids to play in the yard? Is it safe to grow a garden? What is going to happen to my farm animals?These are important questions that deserve to be answered. Today there are no clear answers. Why? Because no one has done any testing for dioxins anywhere in East Palestine. No one.",

The cans will come in 187ml, 200ml and 250ml sizes.The move to “vin in a tin” is expected to save more than 300 tonnes of glass packaging and will halve the carbon footprint per drink because the recyclable cans require less energy to transport as they are lighter and take up less space than bottles.The move comes after the popularisation of “gin in a tin” and other canned cocktails, particularly during the pandemic lockdowns, which prompted outdoor drinking and picnics.Drinks makers have been seeking alternative packaging because the price of glass has almost tripled since the start of the pandemic amid increased demand for other material besides plastic packaging.The price of aluminium has also risen but by about a third, according to data from letsrecycle.com. Waitrose said it would not necessarily make cost savings from the policy shift as it cost more to fill a can.Barry Dick, the beer, wine and spirit bulk sourcing manager at Waitrose, which last year bought in 3m small wine bottles, said: “We’re delighted to pioneer this move and make reducing waste even easier for our customers. We know that more people are buying their drinks in canned formats, from cocktails on the go to craft beer, which is why making this shift in our wine category makes so much sense.“Picking up a can of wine is a great way to enjoy wine in moderation, especially if you’re heading to a picnic or social occasion. It also enables customers to try a new variety without worrying about wastage or cost. We hope the move will encourage suppliers to continue to develop a diverse and exciting range of wines in cans.",

It has killed birch trees and emptied ponds, depriving wildlife of habitat.Hayden has been approached to sell his land but the 65-year-old refused, the emotional investment in the land his father farmed well into his 80s being too high.The developer, L&Q, which worked with Homes England’s predecessor on the first phase of the development, had to lower the water levels in order to build on the land, a process known as dewatering.

But that is why we need to plan the transition carefully and fairly, not abandon it and add yet more carbon pollution to the atmosphere.”The government’s attempt to press ahead with the Rosebank field flies in the face of warnings from scientists.

Its terms of reference state: “The taskforce will meet fortnightly, with exact frequency and timings of meetings at the discretion of the chairperson in consultation with the group members.” Its goals are “to develop: proposals to significantly reduce the frequency and impact of sewage discharges from storm overflows short-term actions to accelerate progress to reduce the harm caused by storm overflows”.Last August the group published its storm overflows reduction plan, which gives water companies a deadline of 2035 to reduce the amount of sewage flowing into bathing water and areas of ecological importance. Water companies were given a deadline of 2050 to stop dumping raw sewage elsewhere.The then environment secretary, George Eustice, said water companies would have to invest £56bn over 25 years to tackle storm sewage discharges by 2050.

In a briefing prepared for Britain’s competition regulator prior to the takeover of Southern Water, researchers raised the alarm that private equity-owned water companies would become “impossible” to regulate. Despite the 20-year transparency rule, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has not released the briefing. Its existence was uncovered by this newspaper. Though its full contents remain secret, its implications are clear: ministers were alerted to the devastating impact that this industry could have on England’s water supply, but they chose not to act.Since then, a tide of effluent has polluted England’s rivers. Following the privatisation of water companies in 1989, owners have enriched themselves while neglecting infrastructure and dumping vast quantities of untreated sewage. As investors have loaded water companies with debt, they have continued to pay dividends to their shareholders, which totalled £1.4bn last year. The public, meanwhile, have shouldered the costs. Water bills have risen. Last week, the industry apologised for these sewage spills and pledged to invest £10bn in infrastructure – to be paid for by increases in customer bills. Ruth Kelly, the former Labour cabinet minister who is head of the industry’s trade body, Water UK, said more should have been done to address the spillages. She was silent on the subject of dividend payments.The main line of defence for consumers is supposed to be Ofwat. Yet water companies have run rings around the regulator. Its rules are premised on a version of capitalism that no longer exists. When it was founded in 1989, England’s water suppliers were listed on the stock market, allowing anybody to buy shares in this public resource. Today, most of them have been bought up by investment funds that do not face the same disclosure requirements. Opacity has shielded their finances from scrutiny. Since 2015, water companies have been required to demonstrate their “financial resilience”, and Ofwat will now prevent negligent ones from paying out dividends. But the horse has already bolted, and many of the firms responsible for loading these companies with debt have already moved on.",

More importantly, it will be a chance to look ahead to a new dawn.The solar industry has been easy to underestimate in a country better known for dull drizzly days than blue skies. But it has enjoyed steady growth, is far cheaper than headline-grabbing nuclear investments and far less conspicuous than fields of wind turbines.Solar power made up 4.4% of the UK’s electricity needs in 2022, but the annual figures belie a far greater impact in the summer. Solar regularly accounts for more than 25% of demand when it is producing peak output during the sunnier months. It has also seen a step change in demand due to falling technology costs and a growing desire for cheap, secure energy supplies.Last year, the number of rooftop installations in the UK doubled, according to MCS, an accreditation scheme. It found that a total of 130,596 systems were mounted on UK rooftops in 2022, the same number as in the three previous years combined.In total, the UK has about 15 gigawatts of solar power capacity across the country, according to the industry body Solar Energy UK. The government hopes to increase this to 70GW by 2035.This ambition is not without challenges. Surging demand has led to one of the longest queues for a grid connection in Europe, with many solar developers being told they will have to wait more than a decade.",

It should be no surprise, therefore, that it is Conservative constituencies that have any land to roam on at all.While the report does not detail what green space is counted in cities, where I live in Manchester the council has a policy for how much green space there should be by population, a useful measure in planning, vindicated by the pandemic. A more egalitarian way of quantifying right to roam would be what percentage of green space is available to roam in each constituency, otherwise it would appear that having a large piece of the pie only means you have to share less of it.",

They were intercepted by armed assailants and died at the scene, according to relatives.How Honduras became one of the most dangerous countries to defend natural resourcesRead moreDomínguez and Bonilla were co-founders of Guapinol’s grassroots resistance against an iron ore mine owned by one of the country’s most powerful couples. Domínguez was among 32 community leaders falsely accused of crimes by the mining company and local authorities.Local police and prosecutors immediately ascribed the deaths to a botched mugging – even though the assailants fled without taking the victims’ moped, cellphones or money.UN agencies, rights groups and the US embassy condemned the killings. Relatives and lawyers have questioned the official version of events, pointing to the ongoing threats and harassment faced by the community.“We reject the official hypothesis. These two young men were founders of the struggle to protect our natural resources from an illegal mine that is destroying rivers in the national park. For five years we’ve been threatened, criminalised and falsely imprisoned, the only thing left was murder,” said Rey Domínguez, 58, a community leader and Aly’s brother.“It’s vital that an independent impartial investigation is carried out which must take into account the possibility that Aly and Jairo have been retaliated against for their work defending human rights,” said Michael Phoenix, head of research for the UN special rapporteur for human rights defenders.The Guapinol case stems from a huge open-pit mine in nearby Tocoa, which was authorised inside a protected national park in a process mired by legal irregularities, according to international experts. Community members, including Domínguez and Bonilla, set up a peaceful protest camp after the mine polluted rivers relied upon by thousands of people.",

Though discharged, his condition meant he could not fly. He and his mom therefore set off to drive to Casselton, North Dakota, scheduled to arrive on Tuesday or Wednesday, KPHO, an Arizona news station, reported.Brian Kauffman, Wyatt’s father, said: “I’m thankful he’s coming home in the front seat of the car instead of a [coffin] in the back. Wyatt is doing remarkably well. Wyatt is going to make a full and complete recovery from this.”As he told it, Wyatt was using his phone and camera to take pictures of the views from the “very top” of the Bright Angel Point trail, a popular tourist spot that is markedly steep and narrow.A compilation of photos of Wyatt Kauffman, 13, aired by KPHO-TV after Wyatt survived falling 100ft off the edge of the Grand Canyon.

But he was holding on with just one hand.“I kind of stood up – I lost my grip, and that’s when I started to fall back,” Wyatt told ABC. “I cannot remember anything past that point. I just remember somewhat waking up and being in the back of an ambulance, and a helicopter, and then the plane” to the hospital.Rescue crews spent two hours using ropes and a Stokes basket to retrieve Wyatt. He was eventually flown to a pediatric trauma center in Las Vegas, to be treated for nine broken vertebrae, a ruptured spleen and a collapsed lung.",

Further fundraising will take place, with members of the new London rewilding roundtable group tasked with sourcing private donations.Goldsmith said: “I’m so excited to be working with Sadiq on this new rewilding taskforce for London. All people need to experience close connection with nature in their lives, and yet for many Londoners this is a remote possibility today.“From green rooftops to pocket parks, nest boxes for peregrines and swifts, rewiggling streams and reintroducing long lost native species, our plan is to weave wild nature back through the very fabric of our city.”There are 1,600 places designated by local authorities as sites of importance for nature conservation, covering 20% of the capital. These include Richmond Park, Sydenham Hill Wood and the downlands in Bromley and Croydon that inspired Charles Darwin’s discoveries. At the moment, just half of these are deemed appropriately managed to conserve or enhance the wildlife.The project will focus on 20-30 of these sites to protect species including stag beetles, sparrows, peregrine falcons and water voles. Khan has stated an aim for all Londoners to live within a 10-minute walk of green space, with this scheme aiming to connect existing spaces so everyone in the capital can enjoy nature.A red deer stag at sunrise on a winter’s morning in Richmond Park, south-west London.

Improving floodplains, rewiggling streams and boosting the health of rivers can alleviate floods, and planting more greenery can ease air pollution.",

It adds that a residential or commercial building with this level of risk would be considered uninsurable.The report is being published before health day at the Cop28 UN climate conference, being held in Dubai. Countries will be discussing how to mitigate the health impacts of climate breakdown, which include the spread of disease and the effects of extreme weather events.“Climate change is increasingly impacting the health of people around the world,” said Dr Karl Mallon, director of science and technology at XDI. “What happens when severe weather results in hospital shutdowns as well? Our analysis shows that without a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the risks to global health will be exacerbated further, as thousands of hospitals become unable to deliver services during crises.”Although some of the hospitals can be adapted to face the effects of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, severe storms, flooding and forest fires, many will have to be moved at great expense.What is Cop28 and why does it matter?Read moreAs with many of the impacts of climate breakdown, this will mostly affect lower- and middle-income countries, where 71% (11,512) of the hospitals at risk by the end of the century are located. Currently, south-east Asia has the highest percentage of hospitals at high risk of damage from extreme weather events. It faces risks in the future too – with high emissions, almost one in five hospitals (18.4%) in the region could totally or partially shut down by the end of the century.",

He played rugby, with more enthusiasm than talent; and, in spite of being Jewish, took pride in reading the lesson in chapel: this gave him an inkling that there might be something true in religion. This conviction developed into an active involvement in the Reform Synagogues of Great Britain, now known as the Movement for Reform Judaism, first in the 1960s as a member of the newly formed Finchley Reform Synagogue in London, and later as chair (1996-99) of the national movement.Born in Cricklewood, north-west London, Neville was brought up by relatives following the hospitalisation of his mother, Rachel (nee Proops), who died when he was five. He remained close to his father, Sam, an accountant, who sent his son, after the disruption of the second world war years, to Haileybury, where he became head boy.He entered the same accountancy firm as his father, who died suddenly when Neville was 22, and remained at Barnes Roffe for the whole of his career, eventually becoming an innovative senior partner. Marriage to Margaret Cohen in 1958, and their devoted raising of three daughters, was combined with his professional life.Meanwhile, his interest in personal development led him to become involved in neurolinguistic programming and the Landmark Forum, an organisation offering training in personal and professional growth. But it was his encounter in 1974 with the spiritual exercises of Subud, an international spiritual community inspired by Islamic mysticism, that became pivotal to his growing awareness that personal spirituality and collective social and environmental transformation went hand in hand.",

Now, though, with conserving water more important than ever, designers have upped the ante with clever models that double as planters, ornaments and even fountains.The market was ripe for a makeover because “one of the barriers to having a water butt is that it’s got to be in your garden, and we want our gardens to look nice, don’t we?” says Gin Tidridge, a product sustainability manager at the B&Q owner Kingfisher.“One of our biggest sellers is a very slimline water butt,” she says. “It is only 100 litres. It’s still a useful volume of water but it’s not too big. When we’re looking at something larger, it’s nice if it looks good.”Many Britons underestimate their daily water usage, with the average person using 142 litres, according to Water UK. The need to use it wisely was hammered home last summer when prolonged dry conditions resulted in a drought being declared across wide swathes of England.The traditional plastic water butts are regarded more as practical rather than aesthetically pleasing. Photograph: Patrick Herzberg/Getty Images/iStockphotoAt the time, Sir James Bevan, the boss of the Environment Agency, outlined the measures ordinary people should be taking in and outdoors to avoid severe droughts – a list that included getting a water butt.“Small things make a big difference,” he said. “Take showers, not baths. Cram the dishwasher or washing machine and only run it when it’s full. Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth. Outside the house, get a water butt: plants prefer rainwater. Use a watering can, not a hose, and don’t water the grass.”The message seems to be getting through, with 76% of the 3,000 adults polled by Kingfisher stating that reducing the amount of water they use is important to them.Some have taken action, perhaps spurred on by having a water meter fitted, with the number one change installing a water-efficient toilet (31%), followed by a water butt (26%) and fitting a low-flow showerhead (18%).",

The subject received little mention at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt late last year, and experts are hoping for greater focus in 2023.David Miliband, the chief executive of the International Rescue Committee, said: “We have done a really bad job of working together on this. That’s especially damaging given that these [migrants and displaced people] are the most vulnerable people, in conflict-driven parts of the world. These people have done the least to contribute to the climate crisis, but are among the most severely impacted.”At Cop27, governments agreed that the poor countries worst afflicted by climate breakdown should receive funds for “loss and damage”, to help them recover and rebuild after extreme weather. Details on how the new global fund should operate are still to be worked out this year, but it must include some form of provision for migration, experts told the Guardian.“There is no doubt that some of the drivers of refugee numbers are conflict and climate change,” said Miliband. “Climate change has a direct and indirect effect on migration, and forced migration. It generally leads to internal displacement, to migration flows within countries.”About 55 million people around the world are internally displaced within their own countries, more than the number who are fleeing across borders. Last year, the total number of forcibly displaced people around the world – including refugees fleeing across international borders – topped 100 million for the first time, according to the UN.",

Could the enforced immobility of life under Covid-19, the rediscovery of neighbourhood shops, parks and walks brought about by the closure of workplaces and schools, lead to a longer-term adjustment – a new car/life balance?For decades, green thinkers and politicians have advocated for a less automobile-centric culture. Transport policy unites two big themes of environmental politics: the idea that many people need to be reconnected with local geographies, both physical and human; and opposition to pollution. This means greenhouse gases, of course, but also particulate matter and noise. An altered transport hierarchy, it has long been argued, is beneficial to health, since more walking and cycling means less obesity, respiratory illness and heart disease; reduced road traffic also means fewer injuries and deaths caused by collisions.The need for cuts in air pollution and carbon emissions (with levels in many UK cities exceeding legal limits), combined with the practical urgency of the situation earlier this year, in which public transport use had to be reduced without increasing congestion, made walking and cycling the only good option. Policymakers saw this: the UK government provided £250m in emergency active travel funding; the Welsh and Scottish governments £15.4m and £10m respectively.Several months later, there is widespread agreement that the creation of dozens of new low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh has produced some toxic politics along with quieter, safer streets. Planters placed on roads to block through traffic have been moved and damaged. Campaigners have been threatened. In several London boroughs, the strength of the reaction has led councils to retreat or consider retreating.New research suggests such decisions are mistaken. The idea that middle-class residents are the main beneficiaries of LTNs is revealed to be a myth, since about 90% of people from all demographic groups live on the kinds of residential streets where they are in place. Meanwhile, the announcement of funding from a south London NHS trust to support schemes in its area shows how significant health experts believe these beneficial effects are.",

A plane with a pūteketeke campaign banner also flew over the beaches of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.Oliver then appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon dressed in a pūteketeke costume to promote the bird.The pūteketeke is known for carrying its young on its back, sharing chick-rearing responsibilities, and eating its own feathers to induce vomiting as a method to expel parasites. It has a chorus of grunts, growls and barks and engages in an elaborate set of mating dances, including the “weed dance” where the birds offer each other water weed and the “ghostly penguin” where they rise chest to chest.The competition, run by environmental organisation Forest & Bird, normally attracts just under 60,000 votes but this year those figures leapt to 350,000 across 195 countries, with 290,374 of those going to the pūteketeke.

Our health and wellbeing should be the core of planning and policymaking.”Her review, published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine,highlights evidence of improvements in air pollution from many low emission zone (LEZ) schemes. More than 320 LEZs now operate across the UK and Europe to curb the use of the most polluting vehicles. It also reports a 6-9% reduction in the traffic pollution in and around a low traffic neighbourhood in London and up to 25% decreases from Barcelona’s “super blocks”, where accessibility and pedestrians are prioritised over cars.Separate research by Imperial College London also found clear reduction in heart and circulatory problems in five out of eight LEZ studies. These included fewer admissions to hospital, fewer deaths from heart attacks and strokes, and fewer people with blood pressure problems. Out of five studies that looked at lung health, two found improvements and the remainder showed no definite result. None showed a clear deterioration.Prof Mark Nieuwenhuijsen from the research institute ISGlobal, who led the new policy review, said: “Air pollution policies often focus on legal compliance and forget that the primary aim is to prevent disease and maintain health. They rely too much on technical solutions and miss the additional health benefits from shifting private car use to public transport, cycling and walking.”A five-year study of 260,000 working people in the UK has found that people who cycled to work were healthier and living longer than those who commuted by car. Along with people who walked to work, cycling commuters also had lower rates of heart disease.",

Of the 1,500 hectares (3,706 acres), 152 are used to grow crops irrigated from the Gwydir River, which include cotton.The NRAR director of investigations and enforcement, Lisa Stockley, said the case is significant because it’s the largest combined fine handed down in a land and environment court prosecution since NRAR started in 2018.“But also it’s the first tier one offence that we’ve successfully prosecuted,” she said. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Under the NSW Water Management Act, Stockley said a tier one offence relates to “intentional, negligent or reckless conduct” and has “more serious penalties”.The four water offences carried a potential maximum penalty of more than $6m.NRAR said expert evidence found approximately 1,418ML of water was taken above what was recorded by the meter during the offending period.That is equivalent to more than 560 olympic-sized swimming pools.",

Hooded seals usually give birth on pack ice, and are rare visitors to these southern latitudes. In the past 10 years, there have been just four records of the species on the islands. Pups are weaned after just four days – the shortest period of any mammal.The seals are silver grey with charcoal faces and dark spots on their flanks, with fur pelts that have made them attractive to humans for coats and hats. Their pups are about one metre long at birth and have blue-grey backs that later develop into their leopard-like spots. Normally the seals follow the drifting pack ice off Arctic coasts such as east Greenland, from where this pair probably came. But now the warming seas are causing ice to melt, and their home territories are becoming unsustainable.The result is that unusual visitors such as these are appearing more frequently. The hooded seal mother and pup were discovered last Monday on land used by the Dutch military for training. The mother disappeared on Thursday, leaving the pup to fend itself. A rescue team from the Zeehondencentrum in Pieterburen, on the north-eastern coast of the Dutch mainland, has since moved the young animal to a more remote location.Like the walruses that have appeared off the Netherlands as well as UK and Irish shores recently, these visitors appear to be reluctant ambassadors of climate change. Hooded seals are used to ice floes and Arctic seas but sandy beaches and tidal flows disrupt normal behaviour – not least breeding and pup-bearing females, as this pup’s predicament shows.Jeroen Hoekendijk, the researcher who photographed the young seal, said the animals were unaccustomed to these waters: “They are deep divers. The shallow and warm southern North Sea is no place for them,” he said. Sandy shores present potential danger, too. “With high tide, a pup can flush away [whereas] the ice floats, and this is no issue.",

Superdrug said it sold an average of 1,300 units of single-use vapes a week in stores and did not sell them online.The company said it had made the decision in order to protect the environment.Lucy Morton-Channon, its head of environment, social and governance, said: “The rate that consumers are using single-use vapes and discarding them is worrying and alarming for the environment. The lasting effects that single-use vapes are having on the environment needs to be addressed, and I am pleased that we’ve decided to remove them from all stores.”Research from the recycling campaign group Material Focus recently found 5m disposable vapes were being thrown away in the UK every week, a fourfold increase on 2022. This amounts to eight vapes a second being discarded, with the lithium in the products enough to create 5,000 electric car batteries a year.Superdrug also cited the risk of fires caused by improper disposal of vapes because many contain lithium batteries.Ministers are reportedly poised to ban single-use vapes amid concerns the devices are being marketed to children. Councils, paediatricians and environmental campaigners are among those who have called for the sale of disposable e-cigarettes to be outlawed.The government said it would soon publish a response to its call for evidence on vaping by young people, which closed in June. David Fothergill, the chair of the Local Government Association’s community wellbeing board, said the GLA was very pleased about the Superdrug ban.He said: “Single-use vapes blight our streets as litter, are a hazard in our bin lorries, are expensive and difficult to deal with in our recycling centres. It is important that a ban is brought in at pace. Disposable vapes are an inherently unsustainable product.”Concern has also been raised about the health risks e-cigarettes pose to the large number of teenagers taking up vaping.",

This is despite the government having promised at the Cop26 climate conference in 2021 to implement the rules.The Environment Act 2021 established a ban on the use of commodities produced on illegally deforested land abroad, but this has not come into force because Defra has failed to publish the list of the commodities covered by the regime.The former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said: “We passed the Environment Act with much fanfare, not least so we could present ourselves as a world leader at Cop26 … and it was a genuinely landmark law to cut illegal deforestation caused by commodity production from our supply chains. But there has been virtually no progress since the law passed and not a single tropical tree has yet been saved.“It should go without saying that there is no solution to climate change, indeed there is no future for our species, if we fail to halt the loss of the world’s great forests. So the government needs to stop with the delays and U-turns and get on with it.”An investigation by Global Witness and Trase has found the UK is still importing seven commodities associated with deforestation including palm oil, soy and cattle products.Of the estimated total 20,400 hectares (50,400 acres) of deforestation linked to UK imports between November 2021 and July 2023, 8,800 hectares were estimated to be linked to palm oil, 3,470 hectares to soy, and 2,950 hectares to cattle products.The researchers said these numbers were likely to be underestimates because they included raw commodities rather than processed products that contained the ingredients, such as chocolate.Campaigners also said the UK’s regime was weaker than that of the EU, which covered deforestation and forest degradation. The UK’s ban covers only illegal deforestation.",

A third by Etihad offered potential customers “total peace of mind”, mentioning their environmental advocacy. All three were banned from appearing again for breaking rules on misleading advertising and environmental claims.In each case, the ASA said the ads could not corroborate their environmental claims, because the UK ad code required such absolute claims to be “supported by a high level of substantiation”.The ruling, published on Wednesday, upheld the complaints against the airlines on the grounds they gave a misleading impression of the impact of air travel on the environment.“We understood that air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. We also understood that there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry that would adequately substantiate absolute green claims,” read the ruling against Etihad.It is the second time this year that Lufthansa and Etihad have fallen foul of UK marketing rules.Lufthansa, which promised it would stop using the slogan “fly more sustainably”, said a paid-for Google ad did not provide space for a full explanation of “green fares” but that consumers could follow a link for more information supporting its ad claims.Etihad said after receiving notification of the complaint, it had removed all references to “environmental advocacy” from its Google adverts in the UK. Air France-KLM did not respond to the ruling.Aviation accounts for about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions and continues to rise, driving global heating.",

Starmer said: “We will accept the baseline that we inherit from the government if we win that election … in order to ensure we have the stability that we desperately need in our economy.”Joe Hesmondhalgh, 24, a farm worker and volunteer at Green New Deal Rising who had been protesting outside shadow cabinet offices, said Labour must go further.“This government’s approval of the Rosebank oil and gas field condemns young people like me to an unliveable future. If the Labour party truly wants to represent us, they must definitely oppose Rishi Sunak’s climate extremism and commit to revoking Rosebank’s licence and delivering a transformative Green New Deal if they win power,” Hesmondhalgh said.Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero, said this week that Labour would double down on making the case that tackling the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis could only be done in tandem, despite the intensifying Conservative attack on net zero policies.He said Labour would argue that seeking green growth was the way to bring down household bills and secure the future of the UK economy. He said the party believed that Rishi Sunak’s U-turns on key net zero policies revealed a weakness in his strategy, a lack of vision for future economic growth, and would add to the cost of living for people on low incomes.",

And it failed, 12 October). This announcement was no doubt music to the ears of the construction industry, much as John Prescott’s Pathfinder programme, with its egregious narrative of social cleansing and enforced renewal, was widely perceived as a sop to potential party donors in the building industry.The Labour party would seem to have forgotten that we are living with a climate crisis, and the most sustainable homes are the ones that already exist in our cities. These should be urgently upgraded and fully insulated, without question. Unfortunately, UK governments have collectively subverted this objective by levying VAT on such improvements in existing residential buildings. This is surely one of the great environmental scandals of our time.David J BlackEdinburgh Having sat on local planning committees and seen the damage that badly conceived housing schemes wreak on rural communities, I fear for the future. Such developments damage the environment and are completely at odds with the UK’s net zero commitment. In addition, planning laws that are there for good reason would be torn up, and the views of local people ignored.The vast sums that would have to be spent on these mammoth projects should be used to improve existing housing and crumbling infrastructure – hospitals, schools, roads – neglected by politicians for decades. Levelling up should be in the forefront of Labour’s minds. Catherine FrancisHurtmore, Surrey I wonder if Simon Jenkins has ever thought to ask the people who live in new towns whether they consider them to be a success or a failure. My family and I benefited greatly from moving to the new town of East Kilbride. It is unfair to conflate new towns with brutalism. Cumbernauld should not be condemned as a brutalist failure because its town centre building was demolished any more than Portsmouth should be condemned for the demolition of the Tricorn centre.

This species is relatively common in open waters of the twilight zone, between about 500 and 1,000 metres down, so it was a surprise to find this one in the trawl net that Tea and his team were using to sample animal life closer to the seabed.The viperfish’s teeth form a trap for prey and are very difficult to see. Photograph: Museum VictoriaThe viperfish’s splendid teeth not only form a trap for prey, but they’re very difficult to see. “Having really transparent, big teeth, allows you to conceal something that is otherwise very obvious and very evident,” says Tea.A few years ago, a study of a closely related species of deep-sea fish, the shiny loosejaw (Aristostomias scintillans), uncovered the secret of their see-through teeth. They’re made of enamel and dentine, the same substances as human teeth. The intricate nanostructure of their teeth scatters very little light and instead lets it pass straight through. This means the fish’s teeth don’t twinkle in the bioluminescent lights made by so many animals in the deep sea.Along with other members of their family, the Stomiidae, including dragonfish, stareaters and loosejaws, viperfish have another trick that helps make them even more formidable predators of the deep. Their jaws aren’t fixed firmly in place but are loosely held together with ligaments and cartilage, allowing them to be slung open very widely.They also don’t have stiff vertebrae at the back of their skulls. “Imagine having a neck with no bone,” says Tea. “If you bend your neck really far back, and your jaw extends really far forward, you end up having these enormous gapes that are otherwise quite impossible.",

The animals will be closely monitored as they transform a former commercial pine plantation into a wild wood.Longhorn cattle in the Kent woods.

The ponies complement this by clearing soft vegetation, while the pigs dig around looking for roots and bulbs, spurring new seeds to germinate. The longhorn cattle open up the tree canopy and their actions will be compared with those of the bison. All the changes will encourage bats, birds and other creatures to thrive.“This is where the project really starts to come to fruition,” said Paul Hadaway, of Kent Wildlife Trust (KWT), which runs the project along with the Wildwood Trust. “We’ve had the bison now for eight months settling into this site and doing some amazing stuff. But the intention was always to have as close to a natural grazing assemblage as we could recreate.“If you go back to when these English woodlands first evolved, they would have had mega-herbivores. So this is about returning back to that kind of natural management, to create a much more climate-resilient, adaptable landscape. The pigs are each capable of ploughing about four acres of land a year.”Alison Ruyter, also of KWT, said: “Wilder grazing is about using native wild breeds of livestock to mimic the things that mega-herbivores would have done in the past when wild horses, aurochs and bison roamed around the country.”The five-strong bison herd was completed in December with the arrival of the bull.

But I’ll come back to that.Three months later, Hargreaves did it again, reaching the summit of K2 on 13 August. It was to be her final ascent. Hours later, she and five others died when they were engulfed by a storm. She was 33 years old. Back home in Fort William, her husband, Jim Ballard, had to tell their children, then four and six. Jim recalls 25 years later that Kate “cried and shouted”, and Tom asked if he could go and see “Mum’s last mountain”. Unbelievably they did, and Terrill went with them. Their grief-stricken expedition to K2’s base camp formed the backbone of Terrill’s first documentary about this extraordinary family of adventurers. Footage from it, such as the heartbreaking moment when Tom sees a wisp of cloud caressing K2’s tip and asks his dad “is that Mummy?”, reappears here.Except this time the subject is the life and death of that very boy, Tom Ballard, who became a climber as gifted and committed as his mother and died at almost the same age as she did on a mountain, Nanga Parbat, 100 miles from where her body lies forever encased in ice.",

These long-term problems affect people’s lives and place big burdens on our economy and health services.Earlier this month the UK government announced a target for the worst particle pollution in England in 2040. It means that England plans to meet the 2005 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in 18 years’ time, 35 years after the guidelines were set. The new health study found an extra 20% chance of multiple long-term illnesses for those living with particle pollution that is worse than the 2040 England target.Dr Ioannis Bakolis, from King’s College London, who led the study, said: “We will need to track people’s changing health over time to know for sure if air pollution caused these chronic health problems. If air pollution exposure indeed affects risk, it presents an opportunity to shape the epidemic of multiple long-term illness using environmental policy such as expanding low-emission zones or avoiding building care homes in pollution hotspots.”It may be decades before we get data on the progress of these chronic illnesses, but we can learn by looking into the past. Seventy years ago, London was coping with the deaths of about 12,000 people in the city’s worst ever smog. A subsequent Ministry of Health report reviewed past death records and found that smogs had been killing people over the previous 80 years. The evidence had been there all along.",

Fitting a new ridge does not require the rest of the building to be exposed to the elements, so rain is not an impediment to work. It can even make the ridging easier, as wheat is more pliable and easier to shear when wet.Hazel spars (or pegs) are soaked overnight before being used to hold a thatched roof ridge in place.

But … these amazing abilities are in the open space where we see them. They are just the tip of the iceberg,” said Dr Marc Badger, first author of the research at the University of California, Berkeley.Writing in the Journal of Experimental Biology, Badger and colleagues describe how they created a setup involving four Anna’s hummingbirds and two fake flowers.Each flower only refilled with nectar when the bird visited the other flower, resulting in the birds flying back and forth between them.The researchers then separated the flowers with one of seven different partitions featuring a circular or oval aperture, the height and width of which varied from the same size as the wingspan of the birds (around 12cm) to half that distance (6cm).The researchers presented each of the seven apertures to each hummingbird 10 times, and recorded them making two trips between the flowers each time, resulting in 140 filmed trials per bird.These recordings revealed that the posture of the birds as they flew through the apertures fell on a spectrum between two very different poses.00:00:36Video recordings reveal hummingbird strategies to pass through holes – videoIn one extreme, the birds swept back their wings against their body and paused their flapping to rapidly pass through the aperture like a bullet.In the other they took a slower approach in which they rolled their body and turned their head to pass sideways through the hole while continuing to flap, with one wing tilted forward and the other backwards.The researchers found both techniques were used on most of the apertures, although for the smallest circular aperture the birds almost always used the bullet-like approach.",

There are two polar bears, one to the right and one to the left. They are siblings, named Sizzel and Todz, who used to live with their mother at the zoo. The space is arranged like a theatre. It’s rare for polar bear enclosures to have a dedicated viewing area like this. The window has a history: one bear, Vicks, the older brother of Sizzel and Todz, broke it by hitting it with a rock.This wasn’t the first time I tried to take this picture. I’d been to the location before, in 2014, but wasn’t satisfied with the result. Two years later, I tried again. I stood in this theatre and waited for half a day. Usually, the bears are resting or playing somewhere else in the enclosure. But here there was a moment of theatre, because it was a feeding session, which is a show in itself. The people are watching the bear and the bear is looking back. The little boy in the bottom right balances the image. The photo, and the White Bear series that it’s part of, asks: “What brings us here? What brings us to the point where we, as a species, are viewing wildlife behind glass windows? What is the purpose of these animals being in captivity?”Polar bears have become a powerful symbol of the climate crisis. When looking at this photo, viewers often think about that – and contemplate the role of zoos and aquariums as “last resorts” for a species’ survival. It’s not for me to say if this climate crisis connection adds poignancy to the image. I don’t wish to exploit that symbolism. My humble project aims primarily to explore the potential problems of zoos, such as poorly designed enclosures, lack of space and boredom among the animals.",

He has put a small computer data processing centre underneath the pool and the energy from it heats the water.The idea has taken off and up to 20 public pools could be upgraded to the heat system this year.“We built a small data centre in Exmouth leisure centre. Most normal data centres waste the heat that the computers generate. We capture ours and we give it for free to the swimming pool to heat the pool,” Bjornsgaard told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.The technique works for the data centre and the pool – the heat from the computers warms the water and the transfer of heat into the pool cools the computers.“It’s great for them – they get to reduce the cost of heating the pool and reduce the amount of carbon they use, and good for us because we can offer cheaper computer services because we don’t have the cooling costs,” Bjornsgaard said.The idea was part of a change in the data centre industry, he said. For 30 years there have been huge buildings, often in the middle of nowhere, with millions of computers in them generating a vast amount of heat.“As the world moves, we need 10 times the amount of computers and we cannot build 10 times the amount of data centres,” he said. “So there is a need to decentralise them and take little bits of them to where the heat is required.”Sean Day, the manager of Exmouth leisure centre, said its energy bill was expected to rise by £100,000 this year.“The partnership has really helped us reduce the costs of what has been astronomical over the last 12 months – our energy prices and gas prices have gone through the roof,” he told the BBC. “Looking at different ways of how we can save money as an organisation has been awesome.",

The London conurbation, for example, includes chains of lakes, many of which are suitable for swimming, as well as former docks and stretches of the Thames and other rivers that between them could provide far more swimming opportunities than open air pools ever have.The main barrier in the case of the rivers is the dumping of sewage, which may require investment to fix – but that investment is essential for other environmental reasons anyway. In the case of the lakes and docks, the main barrier is simply that landowners – public authorities as well as private landlords – either ban swimming or permit it only in designated areas, often during restricted hours and with significant entry fees.The situation is repeated all over the country: stretches of water could provide free swimming, but access is denied. What is needed here is not huge public expenditure, but political will. Margaret DickinsonLondon John Harris is right to point to the demise of the country’s public swimming pools and associated leisure centres. I would question the need to heat outdoor pools in Devon between May and September, in particular the pool he mentions in Buckfastleigh, currently costing £26,000 a year to heat. In May 1945, at the age of 11, I had swimming lessons in an unheated pool opposite our school at Hoylake. I believe that very few, if any, public pools were heated at that time.Were we tougher in those times? Perhaps we were – but maybe this current financial climate presents an opportunity to toughen up again – and set about enjoying a full summer of unheated outdoor swimming.Donald RiggTotnes, Devon John Harris reminds me of an occasion in the 1980s when we in Gateshead were favoured with a ministerial visit.",

That said, “if you want to use it mainly as a pressure cooker, you’d do much better to buy a stovetop model”. In terms of size, bigger is often better, Phipps says, because it gives you more options; she has cooked as much as 500g dried beans in her four-and-a-half-litre pressure cooker and as little as 50g rice.You would also be wise to follow recipes designed specifically for pressure cookers, “because it isn’t obviously intuitive”, Phipps says. “You’ll soon get to a point where you can make educated guesses, though.” For example, rice, pasta and pulses, which are cooked by absorption, are a game of ratios: Phipps uses 2:5 rice: liquid for risotto, while basmati requires equal parts rice and water.",

The report also exposed what it said was Facebook’s role in facilitating the dissemination of false claims about global heating by failing to consistently apply its own policies to stop erroneous advertising.“Despite Facebook’s public support for climate action, it continues to allow its platform to be used to spread fossil-fuel propaganda,” the report said. “Not only is Facebook inadequately enforcing its existing advertising policies, it’s clear that these policies are not keeping pace with the critical need for urgent climate action.”The report found that 25 oil and gas industry organisations spent at least $9.5m to place more than 25,000 ads on Facebook’s US platforms last year, which were viewed more than 431m times. Exxon alone spent $5m.“The industry is using a range of messaging tactics that are far more nuanced than outright statements of climate denial. Some of the most significant tactics found included tying the use of oil and gas to maintaining a high quality of life, promoting fossil gas as green, and publicizing the voluntary actions taken by the industry on climate change,” the report said.The report noted a rise in spending on Facebook ads in July 2020, immediately after then-presidential candidate Joe Biden announced a $2tn climate plan to promote the use of clean energy.

Photograph: blickwinkel/Alamy“In the early 1990s we only ever saw the wasp spider on the south coast of England, in Dorset,” said Williams. “This was at the extreme north of their range because it was too cold for them. I would never have imagined then that one day they would be found as far north as Bath as we live with the realities of climate change.”The Jersey tiger moth used to be found on the Channel Islands, but has become an increasingly common sight across the south of England, including on the farm. Other recent new arrivals include the green meshweaver spider, the ivy bee and the lesser hornet hoverfly.Williams used to work as a professional ecology consultant for organisations such as Natural England and the National Trust. Now, as he lives next to the farm, he studies changes on his doorstep rather than nationally.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

        "text": "This weekend, I sowed the first of my seeds of the season. Five varieties of tomato and two different kinds of aubergine. I’m not one for sowing seeds early, but tomatoes and aubergines need every day of the growing season in this country to offer up the best possible harvest. Last summer, the tomatoes were incredible: they thrived in that mind-bending heatwave. They more than made up for the year before when blight obliterated every plant before even one tomato had dared to ripen. No two years are ever the same in the veg patch.Gardeners and growers are well versed in the nature of change. Understanding how the shifting seasons and weather patterns affect our plants enables us to determine when our interventions will be most timely. This year, gardeners at the Royal Horticultural Society, who have been studying buds across the country, are reportedly expecting a bumper blossom in spring. The combination of last year’s heat and light with the cold snap this February is expected to produce ideal conditions for flowering.That said, there’s always an element of guesswork, as we watch the sky and the mercury, check our diaries and last year’s notes, then try to guess when the last frost will pass. We attempt to follow the gardening calendar even though so little in our gardens can be accurately predicted.Despite what plants have taught me about living and working with forces beyond my control, I’m nonetheless prone to bouts of climate anxiety. All it takes is a few days of unexpectedly erratic weather for panic to rise up in my throat. The sheer scale of the climate crisis has felt so overwhelming at times that I’ve found myself succumbing to hopelessness at times. Yet, it is through working with plants that I’ve found an antidote to this particular angst – to pay even more attention to the wonder of the natural world instead of choosing to turn away. And right now, as winter gives way to spring, is the ideal time to institute a practice of noticing.",

        "text": "During an expedition in the cold waters of the Bering Sea, between Russia and Alaska, last summer, a team of scientists spotted neat lines of holes poked into the seafloor. But they did not know who – or what – had created them.Scientists on the German research vessel Sonne set about hunting for clues. They sifted through several hundred images captured by a camera towed above the seafloor.The pictures revealed distinctive rows oval-shaped holes, each measuring roughly two or three centimetres – as if something had pogo-sticked a short way over the seabed. But the mystery remained – until now.The discovery happened by chance. Various animals were spied nearby and became suspects. “Most things were pretty easy to exclude,” says Julia Sigwart from the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Frankfurt. The holes were too small for sea urchins to fit into, and the wrong shape to be worm burrows.Then one of the team, Angelika Brandt, also from the Senckenberg Museum, noticed something: a little crustacean.“Angelika jumps up, she points at the screen and says: ‘It’s that! That’s the maker!’ and then she ran out of the room,” says Sigwart.A few moments later, Brandt returned with an external computer hard drive and showed everyone a video that had been shot 40 years earlier by a colleague. It was an amphipod – a relative of beach-dwelling sand hoppers – from Antarctica, filmed in captivity busily digging a burrow in the sand in its aquarium. Using its huge front appendages, it was carefully shovelling sand out of a hole and heaping it in a neat pile without letting it slide back in.A giant grenadier swims past the burrow, with a probable long-spined sea urchin inside the larger hole. Photograph: Wiley online libraryThe Antarctic amphipod looked a lot like the one Brandt spotted in the Bering Sea. “When I saw the animal sitting in that hole, it was really a deja vu moment,” she says.The Bering Sea amphipods have yet to be caught making the holes, but Brandt and colleagues think they are probably eating sediment in nutrient-rich layers of the seabed, and digging tunnels as they go.",

        "text": "I am an environmental social scientist and climate activist. As Jack Shenker describes in his article (The existential question for climate activists: have disruption tactics stopped working?, 6 March), Extinction Rebellion’s recent decision to stop disrupting the public caused quite a fuss. Some people applauded the move as they thought it would favourably shift public opinion, while others insisted public disruption needs to remain a primary tactic to garner wider attention.Unfortunately, both camps are missing the point – once you have enough dedicated activists, the public is largely irrelevant to achieving political change. It is not the opinion, or even attention, of the public that matters, it is whether or not you are disrupting structures of power. Historical social movements have shown this repeatedly.Despite what we may like to believe in a democracy, public opinion is only one small influence on the government. It may theoretically give governments a mandate to act, but real change must first overcome powerful opposition from the structures that support governments, such as business and the legal and financial systems. The role of activists is to change the cost-benefit equation for these structures until it is more beneficial for them to accept change than to carry on with the status quo.For climate activists, the real question is not about the efficacy of disruptive tactics, it needs to be about targets. And the answer is power, not the public.Dr Laura Thomas-WaltersLlandaff, Cardiff What can we do about the climate crisis? What form should our protest take? Do the actions of Extinction Rebellion risk alienating those who they look to for support? Indigo Rumbelow, a supporter of Just Stop Oil and co-founder of Insulate Britain, takes the view that the debate “is not between those who want to take ‘moderate’ or ‘radical’ action. It’s between those who are standing by doing nothing at all, and those who are doing something. That’s where the line is drawn.”But it should never be like this. A democracy should allow voters to choose how their country is governed. There should be a constitutional requirement for those of us seriously concerned about the climate crisis to have our views expressed in government. This obviously doesn’t happen.",

        "text": "The climate is changing more quickly now than it has done for tens of millions of years. This was the blunt conclusion to the BBC’s recent Earth series, which sought to convey to viewers how cataclysmic the disruption caused by global heating could be. Chris Packham, its presenter, described the tipping points that were reached 56m years ago, when, over the course of a few thousand years, temperatures climbed by 5C. Fossil records from this period are one resource that modern scientists use when trying to predict the consequences of the much faster heating that is now under way.Planetary boundaries, about which scientists this week issued an updated warning, are another tool for thinking about the environment. These are a set of parameters defined at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, led by Prof Johan Rockström, in 2009. They are limits within which changes to the Earth’s life support systems, which have been relatively stable for 10,000 years, can be considered manageable. Once the boundaries are breached, however, everything becomes much more extreme, unstable and threatening. As well as an attempt at quantifying the disruption that natural systems can withstand, the nine boundaries represented an attempt to broaden understanding of the risks. One key message was that global heating caused by greenhouse gases trapped in the atmosphere is not the only threat.The latest assessment, that six out of the nine boundaries have been broken, is yet another wake-up call. For the first time, scientists assessed the situation across the whole world and are particularly concerned about their findings with regard to biodiversity, freshwater and land use. Along with phasing out fossil fuels, they argue that ending destructive farming practices – which cause deforestation, habitat loss and pollution on a massive scale – is now the most urgent priority.Prof Simon Lewis describes the boundaries framework as a “heroic attempt to simplify the world”. As such, it has something in common with Kate Raworth’s doughnut economics. But, however valuable such concepts are, ultimately they will be judged on whether they can help prompt the imposition of actual limits on fossil fuel production, and other damaging activity, that can only be imposed by governments.",

But its requested cleanup budget increased just $400m over the same period, according to the new report by Environmental Working Group (EWG), a non-profit that tracks the military’s PFAS pollution.US agency takes unprecedented action to tackle PFAS water pollutionRead moreAt this pace, many of the sites will remain tainted for at least 50 years.“The DoD is facing a ticking cleanup time bomb as funding falls dramatically behind cleanup costs,” said Jared Hayes, a senior policy analyst at EWG. “The DoD has an obligation to its service members, the families living on bases, and the surrounding communities that have already been contaminated, so they need to clean up their mess.”PFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. The compounds are ubiquitous, and linked at low levels of exposure to cancer, thyroid disease, kidney dysfunction, birth defects, autoimmune disease and other serious health problems. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally degrade.PFAS are thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million Americans, and military bases are a major source of pollution because the DoD has used firefighting foam that contains high levels of the chemicals during training and emergencies. The military previously “downplayed” the number of service members exposed to the chemicals, EWG found, which the group estimated in the millions over recent decades.The level of contamination at the many polluted bases is staggering: as high as 20.7m parts per trillion (ppt) for one PFAS compound in England, Louisiana. The EPA has recommended drinking water limits of four ppt for some PFAS compounds.",

        "text": "The restoration of much of Britain’s vast canal network has been a notable and uplifting success story. Originally saved in the 1960s from Beeching-style closures by Labour’s transport secretary, Barbara Castle, many of these formerly working and polluted waterways have become modern urban oases.Otters, kingfishers and dragonflies can be glimpsed along the 100 miles or so of Birmingham’s canals. In Manchester, barge users and walkers can trace the origins of the Industrial Revolution along intersecting routes that crisscross the city. Across the country, canalside regeneration has transformed urban landscapes, partly enabled by the thousands of unpaid volunteers who rescued abandoned channels from dereliction and paved the way for Castle’s vision of “leisureways” to become a reality.Environmentally rich, historically fascinating and a source of human wellbeing, thriving canals should be a treasured feature of our greener future. The government, however, appears to have other ideas. Having previously frozen funding for the Canal & River Trust (CRT) – the charity that in 2012 took over the management of 2,000 miles of state-owned canals – ministers now plan cuts of over £300m to its finances, beginning in 2027.As the CRT is forced to seek alternative sources of cash, this shortsighted decision will stretch resources beyond breaking point. Volunteers already have to be relied on for clean-up work and other tasks, and trust leaders have said that the sharp reduction in funds will put at risk “invaluable natural habitats, historic infrastructure and cherished public spaces”. Some canals, they warn, may have to close. Last week, a group of council leaders wrote to the secretary of state for the environment, Thérèse Coffey, noting that large stretches of London’s network will be affected, including Little Venice.There are many good reasons to want to see the back of this government, but one of the most emotionally compelling is its distaste for the kind of public infrastructure that makes life better for people. It remains to be seen whether ministers will choose to ignore the overwhelming opposition to plans to close railway station ticket offices. But their apparent willingness to endanger the spectacular renaissance of the country’s canals is evidence of the same ideological blind spot: the modern Conservative party just doesn’t understand the value of public goods.",

It found 22% of the items in a typical British grocery shop were at risk.Some effects have been seen already. Earlier this year, UK supplies of tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, peppers and citrus fruits ground to a halt as drought hit parts of Spain and Morocco.Yadira Lemus’s family has been farming coffee in the hills of Honduras for generations, with their farmland almost perfect for the crop. “We would plant coffee and it produced almost by itself,” she said.But old certainties can no longer be relied upon. “It is harder to predict the weather,” Lemus told researchers from Christian Aid. “Before we could say which is winter or summer, and when we can plant. Not any more.”‘There will be fewer British tomatoes on the shelves’: soaring energy costs force growers to quitRead moreLemus, who is part of a women’s group working with the support of Christian Aid partners to implement climate adaptation projects, said the difficulties she and fellow coffee cultivators were facing were “obviously related to climate change”.She said: “Who was going to predict that we were going to have the storms and hurricanes we had last year? Now you see there is a lack of rain. We are more vulnerable to these types of changes.”Further global heating would mean more harvest-destroying extreme weather events, researchers say, leaving consumers facing further shortages and long-term prices rises.

Current action and policies mean the world is on track for 2.7C of global heating.The researchers also examined the impact of ski tourism on the climate and found artificial snowmaking contributed just 2% of overall emissions. Tourist flights to resorts and accommodation were the main causes of emissions.In stark contrast: the warming of Europe’s ski resorts – photo essayRead moreArtificial snowmaking in some resorts in the Alps, Nordic countries and Turkey could compensate for snow shortfalls as the climate heats, the study found.

The most recent ski season was a poor one, with record-breaking warm winter weather closing ski slopes from Chamonix in France to Innsbruck in Austria.Dr Samuel Morin, research scientist at Météo-France and CNRS in Toulouse and Grenoble, said: “Ski tourism is a niche issue in the face of climate change, but from the point of view of the people who live in the mountains and make a living from the industry, it is very important to really understand to what extent climate change is threatening the activity, and to take into account the impact this activity has on the climate.”Prof Paul Peeters at Breda University in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the research, said: “The study delivers detailed input for policymakers, investors and the tourism sector, encouraging them to reconsider whether it is wise to maintain high dependency on winter tourism in certain areas.",

The scathing conclusions could be summed up in a single sentence: Westminster continues to talk the talk, but a lack of follow-through means the country is failing to walk the walk.In too many areas, the CCC found, goals were being undermined by failures in delivery programmes. There was a “shocking gap”, it reported, in policymaking to drive better insulation of homes. Progress on reducing farming emissions had been “glacial”. The bald conclusion was that the “current strategy will not deliver net zero” by 2050, as legally required.Given Rishi Sunak’s failure to include the government’s net zero strategy in his five key priorities for this year – and the prime minister’s reluctance to turn up at the November Cop27 summit in Egypt – it is perhaps no surprise that the sense of drift continues. At the weekend, it emerged that cabinet ministers have been warned they risk court action over the failure to produce policies to meet binding targets. Civil servants at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – the worst laggard of all – are reportedly pleading with the current environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, to publish a viable decarbonisation plan for farms. The CCC has been calling for one since 2018; but successive ministers have shied away from radical change in a sector that is a traditional bastion of Conservative support.Across the board, the evidence is of inertia, short‑termism and a reluctance to use the state to drive a transition that is imperative for the environment and the economy. The future of Britain’s electric car industry, for example, has been jeopardised by a failure to sufficiently incentivise leading battery manufacturers to build gigafactories in the UK.The absence of clarity and certainty in planning is startling.

He brings in and weaves together a head-spinning range of times, places and names: Brazilian novelists, anthropologists and shamans, and European philosophers who visited or wrote about Brazil. Real and fictional figures rub shoulders; languages and worlds swallow and regurgitate one another, producing what Goddard calls “a swarm of polyglot… words, names and phrases”.There is, to say the least, a lot going on in this relatively slim volume – in this (these?) book(s?).

They added that their findings also highlighted the need to better protect the environment and improve biodiversity in urban, suburban and rural areas in order to preserve bird habitats.The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, tracked 1,292 participants’ everyday encounters with birds last year via a smartphone app called Urban Mind.Over the course of two weeks, the participants, from the UK, Europe, the US, China and Australia, were prompted at random intervals to record how they were feeling, including whether they were happy or stressed, whether they could see trees, and whether they could see or hear birds.Where all the birds have gone this year – a garden survey | LettersRead moreThe researchers found that participants’ average mental wellbeing scores increased when they saw or heard birds, including among those who disclosed they had been diagnosed with depression.This beneficial effect also lasted beyond the moment of encountering birds, with higher levels of mental wellbeing noted by participants who did not see or hear birds the next time they recorded their mood.However, this positive effect did not persist if the participants did not encounter birds during the subsequent assessment of their mood, which the researchers said indicated “a possible causal link effect of birdlife on mental wellbeing”.Andrea Mechelli, professor of early intervention in mental health at King’s College London, said: “We need to create and support environments, particularly urban environments, where bird life is a constant feature. To have a healthy population of birds, you also need plants, you also need trees. We need to nurture the whole ecosystem within our cities.",

Danny Adilypour, its joint lead on sustainable transport and environment, said: “People are entitled to express their views over our low-traffic neighbourhood trials, but there is no excuse for acts of criminal vandalism which put our residents at risk and this is not an effective way to engage with the council or fellow residents.”The council also said vandalism could extend the duration of the schemes by causing delays.In recent months, LTNs have become a highly contested issue, prompting occasional demonstrations and accusations that some schemes, installed during the peak of the coronavirus lockdown, were put in place without sufficient consultation.Councils say they are necessary in part to unclog residential roads increasingly used as rat runs, often by drivers directed by navigation apps. Government figures show traffic on such roads has doubled since 2008.While some academic studies suggest that, given enough time, properly implemented LTNs do gradually reduce amounts of motor traffic rather than redirecting it, opponents say this is not the case and that they can also delay emergency services.",

In Sweden, he said, bringing back wolves almost led to a change of government after people’s dogs were eaten.“These animals only have to consume somebody’s dog and they then become the hound of hell – and what happens is you end up with more hatred for the animal than before you started, which is counterproductive in the long term,” he said.In recent years, support has grown for the idea of reintroducing species that once lived in the UK, and Mears said there were positive examples, including the successful reintroduction of beavers in Argyll. Some people are now calling for the reintroduction of wolves and lynx, which could help restore forests by keeping roe deer and rabbit populations in check. Scotland and Northumberland have been proposed as suitable locations for wild lynx, which were last seen in Britain more than 1,000 years ago.However, Mears said that such efforts would be challenging. “We don’t have vast tracts of wilderness, but we have a broken landscape made up of urban conurbation and farmland,” he said.Even in the most remote areas, there is the question of whether predators will settle at the site after they are reintroduced. “The problem is you can’t contain them,” Mears said. “They are wild animals. They’re very intelligent, incredibly intelligent.",

Ministers encouraged the public to reduce their energy consumption with an advertising campaign.A relatively mild winter in the UK is also expected to have reduced gas demand.ScottishPower said its retail profits were also hit by the cost of buying energy at higher prices before the government guarantee, which covers the wholesale costs for suppliers, was introduced in October. The company hopes to recover a “significant proportion of the losses incurred in 2022” during this year.Profits in ScottishPower’s renewables business, which includes Whitelee, the UK’s largest onshore windfarm, near Glasgow, rose 24% to £730m, helped by windier weather, selloffs of IT and offshore assets, and higher energy prices. Windfarms produced a record amount of Great Britain’s electricity last year.A levy on electricity generators was introduced at the start of the year to capture windfall profits made as wholesale power prices surged. However, ScottishPower said gains made through higher energy prices had been partly offset by charges paid to National Grid to balance supply and demand.",

Elephants of all ages and both sexes were affected, with many walking in circles before dying suddenly, collapsing on their faces. Two months later, 35 more elephants died in north-western Zimbabwe.At the time, the deaths in Botswana were attributed to an unspecified cyanobacterial toxin, government officials said, and no further details were published.But tests on the elephants that died in Zimbabwe have finally come back and shown the cause was a little-known bacterium called Pasteurella Bisgaard taxon 45, which resulted in septicaemia, or blood poisoning.The bacterial infection has not previously been linked to elephant deaths, according to the paper published in the Nature Communications journal. Researchers believe it could have been the same one responsible for the deaths in neighbouring countries.“This represents an important conservation concern for elephants in the largest remaining meta-population of this endangered species,” researchers wrote in the paper. It was written by an international team of researchers from the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust, the University of Surrey, laboratories in South Africa and the UK government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).African savanna elephants are declining by 8% a year, primarily due to poaching, with 350,000 remaining in the wild. The paper suggests that infectious diseases should be added to the list of pressures they are facing.Dr Arnoud van Vliet from the University of Surrey said the infection “adds to the growing list of disease-related threats to elephant conservation”. Elephants are highly sociable animals, and also were likely stressed due to the drought conditions at the time, which made such an outbreak more likely.Pasteurella bacteria has previously been linked to the sudden death of about 200,000 saiga antelopes in Kazakhstan – an incident that researchers believe could shed light on what happened to the elephant herds. Scientists believe the Pasteurella bacteria generally lives harmlessly in the tonsils of some, if not all, of the antelopes. An unusual temperature increase to 37C, however, caused the bacteria to pass into the bloodstream, where it caused septicaemia.",

Auchincloss’s problem is that repetition doesn’t make it more convincing in the eyes of a sceptical market. Investors were already wondering if Looney would bow to pressure to water down his green transition plans further. Now it’s open season for speculation about BP’s future. Takeover target? Breakup candidate? There is an air of instability.That is partly because the two biggest US oil majors are seemingly more confident than ever in their hydrocarbons-for-longer strategies. ExxonMobil is buying the US shale group Pioneer for $60bn (£49bn) and Chevron is making a record purchase by paying $53bn for Hess, complete with access to Guyana’s offshore oil reserves. Both deals are a case of doubling down on fossil fuels, which naturally provokes a fresh round of muttering among a few BP investors about whether renewables will ever earn the same returns on capital as oil and gas. BP’s shares are persistently priced at a valuation discount to those of the US majors.Nor will the mood be improved by the $540m impairment charge in offshore wind in BP’s weak third-quarter numbers on Tuesday, the result of New York authorities rejecting a request to renegotiate terms on two local projects. That will heighten worries about the effect on inflation on other BP wind projects in the UK and Germany.Meanwhile, if the pursuit of size and synergies is suddenly the game again in Big Oil, some wonder if a takeover by Shell, first rumoured about two decades ago, would fit the bill. Alternatively, the undervaluation might be solved by a demerger, separating the oil and gas assets from the newer low-carbon ventures, suggested Nick Butler, a former BP executive and a visiting professor at King’s College London, on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday.Anything can happen, of course. But, before joining the rush to declare that BP requires a radical fix or strategic U-turn, here are a few reasons why now looks to be the wrong moment to hit the panic button.First, BP’s valuation discount to US rivals hasn’t got worse over the past year.",

The UK has set a target of 2035 for a ban on the installation of new gas boilers, although efforts to encourage households to seek low-carbon alternatives have so far stalled.The government stepped in late last year to subsidise energy bills amid fears that the rise in wholesale gas prices would leave many households and businesses unable to afford bills.Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: “It is understandable that [the government] has focused on dealing with the immediate energy crisis over the past 12 months.",

The petrochemical industry, some governments and many environmental groups have pushed for improvements to the recyclability of plastic.Though some types of the material can be recycled, most cannot, and the study highlights how improving recyclability of the material comes with risks: it identified 853 chemicals used in PET recycled plastic and many of those have been discovered during the last two years.The most commonly detected were antimony and acetaldehyde, while potent toxins like 2,4-DTBP, ethylene glycol, lead, terephthalic acid, bisphenol and cyclic PET oligomers were also most frequently found.Moreover, the chemistries of plastics can be something of a black box. In the US, there’s very little regulation around what goes in the material and the EU only requires light testing to determine which chemicals are in plastic.The study characterizes plastics as “very complex materials containing hundreds of different, synthetic compounds which are more often than not poorly characterized for their hazard properties”. Some chemicals found in recycled plastics cannot be identified, the analysis notes, adding to the risk of repeatedly recycling and accumulation.... As the quality of recycled plastic decreases, the amount of potential contaminants goes upBirgit Geueke“It’s not safe, and as the quality of recycled plastic decreases, the amount of potential contaminants goes up,” said Birgit Geueke, the study’s lead author and senior scientific officer with the Zurich-based Food Packaging Forum.",

But now researchers have suggested a similar mechanism may apply to the realm of the nonliving too, underpinning what they have called nature’s “missing law”.A team of scientists and philosophers say many systems – including minerals, changes within stars and even hurricanes – are made up of multiple components that can come together in myriad ways, some of which persist while others fall by the wayside.The researchers go on to propose that which forms persist is governed by a number of selection pressures – similar to the way Darwinian evolution is based on “survival of the fittest”.“We see Darwinian evolution as a specific case of a more general process that applies to nonliving systems as well,” said Dr Michael Wong, first author of the research, based at the Carnegie Institution for Science.“Our proposal applies to static systems, like minerals, and also to dynamic systems, like hurricanes, stars and life.”Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Wong and colleagues say that prior to their work there was no law of increasing complexity, despite many living and nonliving systems evolving over time to display greater diversity, distribution or patterned behaviour.For example, although young stars are primarily composed of hydrogen, which is then fused to produce helium, they can – depending on their size – eventually generate more than 100 elements.Now the team have proposed a law along such lines, suggesting it is underpinned by a similar mechanism to the one already identified in living organisms.“The functional information of a system will increase (ie, the system will evolve) if many different configurations of the system are subjected to selection for one or more functions,” the researchers write.They identified three selection pressures that apply to evolving systems: stability, novelty and the ability to continue fundamental processes.Wong said the new law offered a view of the cosmos rooted in function and highlights important relationships such as how new functions may emerge in the context of new environmental features, inviting important and introspective questions.“After all, Earth’s biosphere is the most complex evolving system we know of so far.",

It states: “Allowing our town and village centres within protected landscapes (such as national parks) to benefit from the right could help ensure the longer-term viability and vitality of these community hubs, supporting the residents and businesses that rely on them.”It specifically cites the aim to give farmers the ability to change their agricultural buildings into houses: “We want to give farmers greater freedom to change the use of their existing buildings to residential use and support the delivery of new homes in rural communities.”However, national park chiefs have said the proposals are “bonkers” and could cause thousands of new developments to mar the views in some of England’s most beautiful areas.David Butterworth, the CEO of the Yorkshire Dales national park, told the Guardian: “If I was trying to devise a policy that would essentially lead to the destruction of Yorkshire Dales national park, this would be the policy. These are permitted development rights to convert a property without any planning restriction. This means the 6,500 field barns in the Yorkshire Dales could be converted into homes. The idea they could be homes with no restrictions would decimate the landscapes.“It is one of the most bonkers examples of environmental destruction I could think of. I am extremely concerned that this has been introduced now with an eight-week consultation. It is just crackers.”Kevin Bishop, the CEO of Dartmoor national park authority, added: “National parks were designated for their outstanding natural beauty. The proposed extension of permitted developments could destroy these landscapes and cause untold harm to the local economy and local communities.",

In 1963 they photographed and published top-secret government plans for maintaining control after a nuclear attack.Jon disclosed his role to me shortly before he died. He admitted he did not have the derring-do to take part in the break-in into one of the secret bunkers intended to govern the country in the event of nuclear war, but he relished the subsequent cloak-and-dagger operation to write the pamphlet and news release that the government unsuccessfully tried to suppress.The group concealed their culpability by buying, using and destroying a second-hand typewriter and duplicating machine: “We drove for hours at night until we found a bridge over a river in the northern Chilterns and threw the incriminating evidence into the water.”He was born in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, the son of Dorothy (nee Duerden), a writer, and Rex Tinker, an accountant, and educated at Charterhouse school, Godalming, Surrey, and Peterhouse, Cambridge, graduating with a degree in natural and moral sciences.Anti-war activity was one of two themes in Jon’s life: the other was natural history, which subsequently morphed into sustainable development. These twin interests took him from secretary to the Committee of 100, an anti-nuclear group, and private secretary to the philosopher and peace activist Bertrand Russell in 1960, to a career in environmental journalism and policy advice. He worked on various publications including the Countryman and New Scientist, and for the International Institute for Environment and Development.In 1986 he co-founded and became director of the London-based Panos Institute, with the aim of providing well-researched information on issues affecting developing countries. It had offshoots in Paris, Washington and Budapest and informed and influenced hundreds of journalists in Africa and Asia. “But what you mustn’t do is prescribe what Country X should do about it,” said Jon. “Many non-governmental organisations don’t understand that.”He had a knack for spotting and acting on important issues before others followed suit, whether the loss of hedges in Britain or HIV/Aids in the global south.",

Rescue spending encompasses management of the public health crisis and fiscal support to insulate against the economic shock, whereas recovery spending focuses on rebuilding and retooling economies post-Covid.“What we found is Australia has spent considerably more on recovery initiatives than most other countries, I think only the United Kingdom has done more,” O’Callaghan said.“That’s understandable because Australia is at the tail end of the virus and we are trying to get the economy going again, while other countries are still in it. Interestingly, Australia has also been a standout on green spending, but unfortunately, on the negative side.“Overall we find that 18% of total recovery spending around the world has gone towards green initiatives, but in Australia, the figure is 2%. Of the major economies, Australia was the worst.”O’Callaghan said this was “a missed opportunity” for the Morrison government and a bad outcome for the country.“The consequences for Australia of low green investment are mammoth on both economic and climate grounds,” he said.“This is the time for us to be reorienting our economy to industries that will drive future growth.",

Everyone was watching when I returned to the beach but they didn’t know that what I had in my hands was ambergris.”Academics inspecting the dead sperm whale in Las Palmas. Photograph: Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran CanariaAmbergris is a rare substance, often known as floating gold, that has been the holy grail of perfumers for centuries. The lump Fernández held in his hand was worth about €500,000 (£430,000).The origin of ambergris, produced by about one in 100 sperm whales, was only solved when large-scale whaling began in the early 19th century. Whales eat large quantities of squid and cuttlefish, most of which cannot be digested and is vomited out. But some remains, and over the years binds together in the whale’s intestines to form ambergris.This is sometimes excreted, which is why ambergris is most commonly found floating in the sea. But sometimes, as in the case of the whale in La Palma, it grows too large, rupturing the intestine and killing the whale.Ambergris has a woody scent like sandalwood but also contains ambrein, an odourless alcohol that can fix and extend the life of scents, hence its popularity among perfumers.Ambergris extracted from the bowel of a dead sperm whale on the island of La Palma Photograph: Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran CanariaThe US, Australia and India have banned the trade in ambergris as part of the ban on hunting and exploiting whales.Fernández, who has conducted autopsies on more than 1,000 whales, said sepsis caused by the ambergris killed the whale.",

To survive as a grassroots movement you have to claim to have access to some higher form of truth that others don’t. But as we Greens are transitioning to something with a broader political appeal, we are working to reduce that claim to truth and have the better arguments instead.”Habeck’s struggles mirror similar developments in the Netherlands, where anger at plans to cut nitrogen pollution led to a shock poll win for a new farmers’ protest party, and Britain, where the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, last week announced a U-turn on some of the government’s climate commitments.Habeck proved his ability and popularity in managing the 2022 energy crisis, but has recently struggled in his effort to overhaul Germany’s fossil fuel-reliant heating sector.A proposed ban on the installation of conventional new gas or oil heating systems from 2024, drawn up by Habeck’s ministry, came under fire this year and was only approved earlier this month after a protracted period of government infighting.In a wide-ranging interview, Habeck also defended the decision to pay the energy-intensive German industrial sector large subsidies to smooth its transition to green technologies.“Our economy is changing,” Habeck said. “But it doesn’t mean we should willingly accept the loss of our old strengths, namely energy-intensive industries like steel or the chemical industry.”In July, the EU gave Germany the green light to pay steel giant Thyssenkrupp €2bn (£1.7bn) of state subsidies for its proposed climate-neutral plant in Duisburg.",

Food wrappers and plastic bottles were also common. The plastic constitutes an “emerging threat” to reefs already stressed by the climate crisis and overfishing, the researchers said.The study, Plastic Pollution on the World’s Coral Reefs, examined 85 reefs at more than two-dozen locations – including uninhabited atolls and reefs at depths of 150 metres – across the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic. It brought together scientists from the California Academy of Sciences; the foundation and charity Nekton; and the universities of São Paulo, Oxford and Exeter.The scientists used special diving equipment to survey in “mesophotic”, or twilight, zones at 30-150 metres (100-490ft) beneath the surface, and discovered the deeper sites had more plastic than the shallower ones.“It was surprising to find that debris increased with depth, since deeper reefs in general are farther from sources of plastic pollution,” said Luiz Rocha, the co-director of the Hope for Reefs initiative at the California Academy of Sciences.Almost three-quarters of larger items found were from ghost fishing gear, with plastic wrappers and bottles also common.

Only around 4% of males become beachmasters.A male beachmaster is flanked by females on a beach.

Research indicates that this could help absorb carbon from the atmosphere and ensure sustainable food production.The new law would see member states monitor the health of soils, fertiliser use and erosion, but stops short of country-level targets for improving soil quality. This drew criticism from the European agri-food industry, which called for more ambition to improve the “worrying” state of soils.Speaking to the Guardian, the EU environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevičius, said the ultimate aim was for the continent to have healthy soils by 2050. More than 60% of the EU’s soils are considered to be in an unhealthy state.“If our soils continue to degrade, the biggest risk is to our food security and farmers. Basically, their business model is wiped out,” he said. “I can hardly imagine how we could do agriculture without fertile soils. The worst effects of droughts and flood can be avoided with healthier soils.”View image in fullscreenThe EU environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevičius, speaking in Brussels on Wednesday.

She calls him sweet, she calls him dorky, she calls him “beekeeping age, I guess”, she lands on: “Summer, I want to fuck your dad.” A working definition: beekeeping age is anyone who should, on society’s cruel terms, be too old to be attractive, and yet is attractive anyway.

It also improved the probability of survival after poisoning.“While the results are promising, further clinical experiments are needed to determine whether indocyanine green has similar effects in humans,” Wang said.A fungi expert and the chief scientist at Sydney’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Prof Brett Summerell, who was not involved in the research, said death cap mushrooms were “extraordinarily dangerous and toxic” and were often mistaken for other mushrooms because of superficial similarities. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “The death cap can in the early growth stages resemble some of the straw mushrooms, which are … popular, particularly in a range of Asian cuisines,” Summerell said.“In those early stages it can be quite difficult to differentiate the mushrooms,” he said. “It’s a white creamy colour. As they get a bit older you can start to get a greeny-yellow tinge to them in the death caps.“Death caps have an association with the roots of oak tree, so if you see something that’s under an oak tree, that’s really when you need to be careful and suspicious.”While the toxins found in some other mushrooms can be degraded by heat, death cap toxins are “robust throughout cooking”, he added.",

        "text": "Recycling has been promoted by the plastics industry as a key solution to the growing problem of plastic waste. But a study has found recycling itself could be releasing huge quantities of microplastics.An international team of scientists sampled wastewater from a state-of-the-art recycling plant at an undisclosed location in the UK. They found that the microplastics released in the water amounted to 13% of the plastic processed.The facility could be releasing up to 75bn plastic particles in each cubic metre of wastewater, they estimated.“I was incredibly shocked,” said Erina Brown, the lead researcher of the study, conducted at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. “It’s scary because recycling has been designed in order to reduce the problem and to protect the environment. This is a huge problem we’re creating.”The researchers tested the water before and after the plant installed a water filtration system and found the filter reduced the concentration of microplastics from 13% of the plastic processed to 6%.The estimate of 75bn particles a cubic metre is for a plant with a filter installed. A majority of the particles were smaller than 10 microns, about the diameter of a human red blood cell, with more than 80% smaller than five microns, Brown said.Microplastics, usually considered to be any particle of plastic measuring less than 5mm, have been found everywhere from freshly fallen snow in Antarctica to the depths of the ocean, and can be toxic for animals and plants.The results also revealed high levels of microplastics in the air around the recycling facility, with 61% of the particles less than 10 microns in size. Particulate matter less than 10 microns has been linked to human illness.The facility was a “best case scenario”, Brown said, given that it had made efforts to install water filtration while many other recycling plants may not.“An important consideration is what other plants globally are emitting,” she said. “This is something we really need to find out.”The study, published in the Journal of Hazardous Material Advances, suggests the recycling plant discharged up to 2,933 metric tonnes of microplastics a year before the filtration system was introduced, and up to 1,366 metric tonnes afterwards.",

This toxic trap must end.”According to the report, the debt owed by global south countries has increased by 150% since 2011 and 54 countries are in a debt crisis, having to spend five times more on repayments than on addressing the climate crisis.Daniel Ribeiro, a programme coordinator for the Mozambican environmental campaign Justiça Ambiental, said the country’s debt burden had been doubled by loans taken without parliament’s permission from London-based banks in 2013, based on projections of earnings from its gas field discoveries.Mozambique was plunged into a debt crisis when oil and gas prices fell in 2014-16, Ribeiro said, but the solutions from international lenders to bail out the country have relied on loans being repaid through future gas revenues.“The debt caused by fossil fuels are being structured to be paid back by fossil fuels, solidifying a vicious cycle of having to move forward and having very severe consequences of not wanting to continue with fossil fuels,” Ribeiro said.Mozambique debt crisis could be first sign of global financial shockwaveRead moreSuriname faced a similar situation after defaulting on its debt, when in 2020 it agreed a deal that would give creditors the right to almost 30% of Suriname’s oil revenue until 2050.",

Our targets for the next few years are also more ambitious than any other major economy and because of that, I thought the right thing to do was to ensure that we get to net zero in a pragmatic and proportionate way that saves working families thousands of pounds.“I’m not in hock to ideological zealots on this topic. Of course we’re going to get to net zero, of course it’s important, but we can do that in a sensible way that saves people money and doesn’t burden them with extra costs.”Sunak announced a U-turn on the government’s climate commitments in September, promising to put the Conservatives on a more radical path in an attempt to close the gap with Labour before the next general election.In one of his biggest policy changes since taking office, he decided to push back deadlines to stop selling new petrol and diesel cars and to phase out gas boilers. At the time, it prompted condemnation from the automobile and energy industries.Some senior Tories, led by Boris Johnson, also criticised the move, with the former prime minister warning his successor that he “cannot afford to falter now” because heaping uncertainty on businesses could drive up prices for consumers.",

Filmed over the course of three years, the five-part series aims to shine a light on the challenges affecting the British Isles and celebrate nature that exists on our doorsteps.But according to the show’s producer, filming on physically demanding terrain – including on the island of Skomer, off the west coast of Wales – meant plans had to be changed at the last minute to avoid seriously risking the 96-year-old’s health.“The shearwaters are not great at taking off, so what the warden on the island said is, ‘If you sit David close to the burrows, they will almost certainly climb up his arm on to his head and take off from his head’,” Alastair Fothergill told the Radio Times. “We thought, ‘Wow, that could be TV gold’. That was the plan.”But it soon transpired that this could have seriously endangered Attenborough. Two weeks before filming was due to start, reports came in that bird flu had hit the neighbouring island of Grassholm, which meant it could also be present on Skomer.“I have an old friend who’s an expert on infectious diseases and I rang him up for his opinion,” Fothergill added. “He said, ‘Well, bird flu is actually extremely hard to catch, but if he [Attenborough] gets it he will die.”Last month it was reported that British health officials are preparing plans to deploy lateral flow tests if signs emerge that avian flu has begun to spread from one person to another.The UK Health Security Agency is also working on blood tests to detect antibodies against the virus and officials will analyse the disease’s genetic mutations to reveal data about the increased risk to human health from avian flu.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.",

        "text": "What would you do with an extra £730? That’s the amount the average UK household wastes each year, by throwing away untouched or unopened food, according to the waste and sustainability charity Wrap. That’s a staggering 2m tonnes and the equivalent of roughly one in every three bags of groceries we bring into our homes. Food waste is not only bad for our pockets, it’s bad for the environment, too: 36m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions could be saved if we stopped throwing it into landfill. Storing ingredients properly to keep them fresher for longer, planning mealtimes and getting creative with leftovers are three simple ways with which we can reduce our food-waste footprint. Let’s start with the UK’s five most-wasted ingredients.Bread We chuck out about 20m slices of bread every day. I always store half my fresh loaves in the freezer, sliced and wrapped tightly. Revive a stale loaf by sprinkling with a little water, placing on a lined baking sheet and into a low oven for a few minutes (or in the microwave in 30-second blasts). Alternatively, turn it into breadcrumbs (or do like the Italians and make pangrattato), use to thicken soups, such as pappa al pomodoro (Tuscan bread and tomato soup), ribollita and gazpacho, or use instead of pine nuts in a pesto; they’re the secret to thicker sauces, too.Leafy greens Some 40% of all bagged salad gets thrown away. To extend its shelf life, wash, pat dry and store half in a sealed container with a sheet of kitchen roll. Blanch the other half, squeeze out the excess water, wrap in a bag and freeze for stews, curries and stir-fries. Or blitz leafy greens with a splash of milk for smoothies, pancake batter or in sweet and savoury bakes such as muffins or chocolate cake – this is a great way to sneak a few extra greens into meals, and you won’t even taste them. You can also freeze blitzed greens in ice-cube trays.",

The huge snapping turtle, known to all as Shnappy, weighs an enormous 50lbs and is a fixture in the New York borough of Staten Island, where he has long resided in Clove Lakes Park.And while the rest of New York struggles with many crises, from recent floods to perennial issues like crime and subway violence, it is the currently unknown whereabouts of Shnappy that has many on Staten Island worried.Shnappy, and his almost-as-large friend Jeffrey, went missing two weeks ago, sparking a wave of conspiracy theories as to their fate. Many locals suspect poachers took the pair for soup, but no one really knows – no turtle thieves were caught on park security cameras.“Anecdotally, we are aware that community members have discussed turtles allegedly being removed from this park, but we have not witnessed this occurring,” said parks department spokesperson Gregg McQueen. “NYC Parks has not directly received any specific accounts or 311 reports regarding people taking wildlife from Clove Lakes Park.”“Wildlife plays an important role in our city’s ecosystem, and it is vital that we do all we can to protect the animals that inhabit our city’s parks and green spaces. It is illegal to remove, harm, or kill animals in parks. If New Yorkers see this activity, they should call 911,” he added by email.But there’s little doubt that the disappearance of Shnappy, who was believed to be a male, and Jeffrey, believed to be a female, has left an emotional hole in Staten Island.“Jeffrey has been here, like, forever,” said Natacha Beck, a hostess at the Stone House, a restaurant and wedding venue overlooking the lake. They, referring to alleged poachers, “would have to have known who he was”.For Stone House, the giant turtles had been a marketing tool. But they were also clever enough to swim over whenever there are customers on the deck. “They’re not stupid,” said Bella Trembone, 20. “They see people sitting and come over for bread.”“We definitely didn’t eat them here – we don’t have turtle on the menu,” she added.",

He turned down three other claimed grounds for appeal. The court hearing is expected in July.A spokesperson for Khan said: “The mayor is pleased to see the court has refused permission for the majority of the grounds.

However, in April it announced a £15bn investment plan to upgrade its factories and launch electric versions its models, starting with the Range Rover.JLR already sells electric cars, but its award-winning battery electric Jaguar I-Pace model has been built in Austria by contract manufacturer Magna Steyr since 2018.In the following five years, JLR’s rivals have launched a series of luxury sports utility vehicles (SUVs) such as BMW’s iX and Mercedes-Benz’s EQC, which compete against Tesla’s Model X.The electric Range Rover is being manufactured in JLR’s factory in Solihull, near Birmingham, using many of the same tools as the existing Range Rovers, which are hybrids that combine smaller batteries with a petrol engine. The shared tooling will allow JLR to shift between electric and petrol hybrid versions more quickly if its plans change.Batteries and electric drive units will be assembled at JLR’s plant in Wolverhampton.The company has not confirmed the price of the electric Range Rover, and customers are registering to gain the option to purchase one when they become available. Prices for the diesel mild hybrid Range Rover start at £103,000.Geraldine Ingham, managing director for Range Rover, said the model was “seeing the highest levels of client demand in our 53-year history”. The car is undergoing hot- and cold-weather testing in Dubai and Sweden.JLR said the car will come with 800-volt charging, which allows much faster charging speeds when using the network of ultra-rapid chargers that are generally located on main roads and motorways for longer journeys.

But researchers say the plants are surprisingly enigmatic after discovering they don’t use conventional processes to track the sun across the sky.Over the course of a day, sunflowers follow the path of the sun overhead – a process known as heliotropism – with their heads tilting progressively westwards as a result of cells elongating on the east side of the stem.At night, cells elongate on the opposite side of the stems resulting in the heads reorienting themselves towards the east.However researchers say the processes behind the solar tracking are an unexpected mystery.“So many of our results were different than we anticipated,” said Prof Stacey Harmer, an author of the research at University of California, Davis.Many plants grow towards a light source – this is because when blue light receptors, called phototropins, are activated on the lighted side of the stem, they cause hormones called auxins to become concentrated on the other “dark” side.These auxins stimulate an elongation of cells, resulting in the stem bending towards the light.While new research suggests this mechanism explains how sunflowers bend towards artificial light indoors, it appears it does not account for the way sunflowers naturally track the path of the sun.Kansas man plants 1.2m sunflowers as 50th anniversary gift for his wifeRead moreWriting in the journal Plos Biology, Harmer and colleagues reported that they first analysed which genes were switched on within the stems of sunflowers grown indoors, when artificial blue light was shone from one direction.The results suggest genes relating to phototropins were primarily “switched on” within the lighted side of the stem, with those related to and auxins and cell growth switched on within the shady side, suggesting sunflowers grown indoors turn towards blue light as a result of conventional processes.But when the team turned to the stems of outdoor sunflowers, they found something different. The east side of the stem, the side in sunlight, and the west side, the side in shade, showed little difference in terms of which of these genes were switched on.",

Overall, people of black or mixed ethnicities are more likely to live in the most polluted places.There is ample evidence that air pollution exposure can lead to preterm and low birth-weight babies. Air pollution then hampers children’s lung growth, increases the chance of childhood asthma and worsens asthma symptoms.Despite this, a new survey by the NGO Global Black Maternal Health has shown a lack of awareness of air pollution risks among expectant black mothers, and those with young children. It also found a need for increased knowledge among the health professionals who care for them.The survey findings were announced at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. It found many black mothers were aware of air pollution but less aware of risks that it posed. Some mothers would like to make lifestyle changes to reduce their air pollution exposure but felt they had few options.Agnes Agyepong, the founder of Global Black Maternal Health and Black Child Clean Air, said: “In the UK, black women are nearly four times more likely to die during pregnancy and experience twice the rate of stillbirth compared with white women. The report aimed to elevate the voices of black women, who are disproportionately exposed to illegal levels of air pollution but largely missing from conversations around clean air.”There are also important differences in air pollution between the richest and least well-off areas. These differences are not confined to London. Across England, the greatest air pollution is found in the poorest and also in the least white communities. During the first decade of this century, the gap between air pollution in the most and least deprived places got worse, not better.But looking at the quality of air that we breathe only shows us part of the problem. There is evidence that the least well-off are more vulnerable to air pollution. This includes studies from Italy and the UK.",

Environmental activists admit it is a hopeless task.“It’s more symbolic than anything else: I don’t think we’re going to pick up the whole container,” said Annick, a retiree who had filled the bottom of a yoghurt pot with a few dozen pellets.Another local, Dominique, who had turned out to help, said: “I wanted to pick them up but it’s endless.

We can try to clean them up by hand, but it’s just a drop in the ocean.” He said the plastic would break down into nanoparticles and be ingested by fish, oysters and mussels, eventually ending up on people’s plates.Jean-Michel Brard, the mayor of Pornic, said he had filed a legal complaint along with two other politicians in the area – Yannick Moreau, mayor of another beachside town, Les Sables-d’Olonne, and the president of the Pays de la Loire region, Christelle Morançais.

Data collected from the software is combined with field records to provide a report on wildlife, rangers’ activities, asset deployment and general infrastructure in a protected area. The kindest cut: sterile scissors are used to make the notch on the rhino’s ear In addition to ear-notching and fitting digital transmitters, transponders are also embedded into rhino horns to link illegally acquired horns to individual animals for stronger prosecution cases in wildlife poaching trials.The first step in ear-notching a highly aggressive black rhino involves firing a dart with a tranquilliser gun from a helicopter. A 4x4 is normally used for the more docile white rhino. The well-coordinated exercise takes about 10 minutes for each animal. Next comes a squirt of an antiseptic spray to prevent infections “Ear-notching is one of our strategic rhino-management plans,” says Dr Isaac Lekolool, head of veterinary and capture services at KWS.",

In 2020, renewable capacity grew by 10.3%, followed by 9.1% in 2021 and 9.6% in 2022. This averages a 9.67% increase, more than double that of the UK over the same period.Graph showing growth in UK renewables capacity The Liberal Democrats’ energy and climate spokesperson, Wera Hobhouse, criticised the government’s failure “to invest in the greenest, cheapest and most popular form of energy” and demanded it do more, including removing restrictions on new solar and wind and empowering local authorities to support decentralised energy that will “not only bring down bills, but also provide skilled jobs for the future”.She said the figures showed the Conservative party could not be trusted with the environment. “They would rather new onshore oilfields than solar farms and wind turbines,” she said.Roger Fouquet, a senior research fellow at the Energy Studies Institute in the National University of Singapore, said that as countries such as Iceland move towards 100% renewable energy, “its investment is likely to slow down, only increasing to meet the rising demand of power”. However, he noted that the UK cannot compare.“The UK’s current renewable electricity capacity is below 50%, and has a great deal of further investment to undertake to claim to be a leader in low-carbon energy systems.",

They believe the levy is needed to create a level playing field that would enable UK companies to invest in cutting their greenhouse gas emissions, without finding themselves undercut by lower-cost but higher-carbon imports from overseas.Jerome Mayhew, a Tory member of the environmental audit committee, is convinced the charge will prove popular in his party, despite misgivings among some of his colleagues. “Applying a cost to carbon unlocks the power of the free market to find cheaper, lower-carbon production techniques,” he told the Guardian. “As Conservatives, promoting free trade and free markets is within our DNA.”Manufacturers will face higher costs for investment in new equipment and processes as the UK moves to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Without a carbon levy, those companies trying to do the right thing would see their costs rise while imports from countries lacking stringent green regulations prospered, resulting in higher emissions overall and damaging the climate and the UK economy.With a carbon levy, known as a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), those overseas manufacturers, in countries such as China, would have an added incentive to cut their carbon footprints and join the green race.Traditionally, though, some Tories have taken the view that a charge on imports would be protectionist. Rishi Sunak, when he was chancellor of the exchequer, roundly rejected the idea of a CBAM, deriding it as likely to raise prices.But his successor in the Treasury, Jeremy Hunt, is understood to look far more favourably on the measure – not least because the EU has brought in its new CBAM, now under trial, that will impose heavy additional costs on UK businesses unless the government responds with one of its own.A proposal for a trial levy may form part of Hunt’s promised response to the US Inflation Reduction Act, Joe Biden’s $369bn package to galvanise green industry.",

Other tortoises in the area have been seen making similar attacks but no tortoise species has been seen actively pursuing prey in the wild before.The Seychelles giant tortoise is a member of the species Aldabrachelys gigantea, which are “generally assumed to be strict herbivores”, according to a study published in Current Biology.Dr Justin Gerlach, the director of studies at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and an affiliated researcher at the University of Cambridge’s Museum of Zoology, led the study. He said: “This is completely unexpected behaviour and has never been seen before in wild tortoises.”Researchers think this new hunting behaviour has been driven by the unusual combination of a tree-nesting tern colony and a resident giant tortoise population on Seychelles’ Fregate island.Previously all tortoises were thought to be vegetarian – although they have been spotted feeding opportunistically on carrion, and they eat bones and snail shells for calcium.Extensive habitat restoration on the island has enabled seabirds to recolonise, and there is a colony of 265,000 noddy terns that leave the ground “littered with dropped fish and chicks that have fallen from their nests”.In most places, potential prey are too fast or agile to be caught by giant tortoises. But scientists said the way the Seychelles giant tortoise approached the chick on the log suggested this type of interaction happens frequently. On the Galápagos and Seychelles islands, giant tortoises are the largest herbivores and eat up to 11% of the vegetation.Gerlach said: “These days, Fregate Island’s combination of tree-nesting terns and giant tortoise populations is unusual.",

Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies?“Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now.“Committing to £20bn over 20 years is frankly pathetic compared to the green growth investments being made in the US, EU and China.”Helen Clarkson, chief executive of Climate Group, said: “This spring budget overlooks cheap and clean renewable energy, and instead rebrands nuclear as ‘environmentally sustainable’ and throws cash at carbon capture technology. This was a missed opportunity to renew the UK’s commitment to climate leadership.”Senior nuclear industry figures said the reclassification would help attract investors to fund the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, which the government has committed £700m towards.Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, called the move a “huge step forward for UK energy security and net zero”.But Stuart Murphy, founder of tidal energy specialist TPGen24, said: “There is nothing environmentally sustainable about a finite resource which leaves a legacy of hazardous waste.",

Two further transport and storage projects, the Viking scheme in the Humber and the Acorn scheme in Aberdeenshire, have now been given government approval. The four CCS hubs are intended to collect CO2 from multiple sources and pipe it offshore to be stored in depleting North Sea gas fields.But, according to Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, announcing more CCS schemes at the same time as approving 100-plus new oil and gas drilling licences is like ordering a truckload of cigarettes for someone giving up smoking.Haszeldine said: “That’s what yesterday’s announcement was doing. CCS should be part of a package of things that you have to do – increasing renewables to switch our energy from burning gas and oil, doubling or even quadrupling the amount of electricity we have now, building in more efficiency in how we use our energy with insulation.

CCS is intended to be used in the transition to net zero to capture carbon from industries that will be harder to decarbonise, including cement, iron and steel, according to Haszeldine.He said: “In these industries, CCS can help and will be essential to get to net zero.”A second nascent industry in capturing CO2 from the atmosphere is less developed than CCS linked to industrial facilities.

Scientists already knew that killing trees reduces evapotranspiration and thus theorised this would result in lower local rainfall.The team at Leeds University have now proven this using satellite and meteorological records from 2003-17 across pantropical regions.Even at a small scale, they found an impact, but the decline became more pronounced when the affected area was greater than 50km squared (2,500 sq km). At the largest measured scale of 200km squared (40,000 sq km), the study discovered rainfall was 0.25 percentage points lower each month for every 1 percentage point loss of forest.This can enter into a vicious cycle, as reductions in rainfall lead to further forest loss, increased fire vulnerability and weaker carbon drawdown.One of the authors, Prof Dominick Spracklen of the University of Leeds, said 25% to 50% of the rain that fell in the Amazon came from precipitation recycling by the trees. Although the forest is sometimes described as the “lungs of the world”, it functions far more like a heart that pumps water around the region.He said the local impact of this reduced water recycling was far more obvious, immediate and persuasive to governments and corporations in the global south than arguments about carbon sequestration, which was seen as having more benefits to industrial countries in the northern hemisphere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

They were driving in Stanmore, north-west London, in July and saw a sign that stated they were entering a low emissions zone. They went online to pay the charge but later realised that the expansion was not due to come in until 29 August.They had clicked on an advert on Google that they assumed took them to an official website to pay the charge.

The ambition is for retailers, rather than the taxpayer, to pick up the tab for these new ways of disposing of defunct, often toxic products safely. The measures are due to come into force in two years’ time.Almost half a billion small electrical items ended up in landfill last year, according to data from the not-for-profit Material Focus. This problem was particularly acute during Christmas, when 500 tonnes of Christmas lights were thrown away, the government said.The latest proposals build on efforts to grapple with the issue that the UK helped develop as a member of the EU. This included the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, which came into effect in 2012. As with other waste-related rules they follow a principle that the producer of the waste will foot the bill for its disposal, which the UK and EU have followed in areas such as plastic packaging.The EU this year adopted policy recommendations for member states to improve collection of recycled materials, although targets vary by country.Post-Brexit, the UK has failed to keep pace with some EU regulatory efforts. The bloc is attempting to reduce e-waste with laws including a right to repair products, and requiring common chargers for phones (USB C) rather than Apple’s specialised lightning charger from 2024 onward. Cables, which are often hoarded as well as wrongly disposed of, are a major contributor to electronic waste.A lack of effective recycling capacity in areas such as battery processing has also left the UK lagging behind European peers on a range of recycling rates. An OECD study of British data shows it failed to meet its recycling targets for household e-waste from 2017 to 2020.",

Unless there’s some compensating reduction in other costs – and I don’t see that – then people have to expect that there will be an increase in in average fares as we go forward.”He added: “It will mean higher fares, because sustainable aviation fuel is more expensive than your traditional jet kerosene. And as we transition to net zero, it is going to cost some money.”Airline costs have been driven up significantly as oil prices soared after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as higher labour costs. Walsh also pointed to constrained capacity due to a lack of spare parts, which have left some airlines unable to operate their full fleets.Despite the much higher fares passengers are having to pay on many routes this summer, Iata said its analysis showed fares worldwide were still around 2019 levels in real terms at the start of 2023, having lagged behind inflation over the course of the pandemic.Last year, Ryanair said the era of ultra-cheap flying was over.",

The capacity to be curious about mental processes – while simultaneously experiencing them – is an important one for an author seeking to describe the human condition. But anyone who values self-awareness will be used to noticing how their mind works and wondering why.“Only connect” was the maxim of another famous novelist, EM Forster. Forster used the characters in his novels to put flesh on his arguments against the emotionally repressive code of the time. But McEwan’s recommendation to disconnect should not be understood as a repudiation of Forster’s humanism. He was not warning writers off paying attention to other people’s minds and ideas – but drawing attention to the need to spend time with our own. In a world of permanent connection, in which attention has been commodified, switching off and away from the outside world is arguably harder than ever before.Many of us are so attached to our phones and other devices that even a temporary separation provokes anxiety (though less so for those whose jobs are not screen-based, and whose communications are arguably better balanced as a result). The Guardian’s new series Reclaim Your Brain is a response to the growing frustration that many feel at the hold that smartphones have on our minds and happiness, and explores ways of resetting that relationship.But tuning out, whether for two hours or two weeks, is not only about defying the masters of the digital universe – or turning back the clock to a time before news was 24/7 and phones were video cameras.

It affected him – and his characters – from childhood to his final days and became an inspiration and a looming presence in his books,” said Frankie Kubicki, the museum’s senior curator.“Fog and smoke were not always seen negatively though; while pollution is often used by Dickens to represent a malevolent force or a shady character, London’s coal fires and twinkling gas street lamps can be heartwarming, nostalgic sights, which comforted Londoners.”The hearth stone fireplace installed by Dickens in 48 Doughty Street, London, now the Charles Dickens Museum.

At that conference, China pledged CO2 emissions would peak by 2030. Xi said that China would “strictly control coal-fired power generation projects”.But 2021 was also the year in which severe power outages blighted many parts of China, leading to rationing, closed factories and cold homes as local authorities struggled to cope with sudden shortages of energy.In 2022, further energy crunches in south-west China underlined the importance of stable energy supplies to Chinese officials. That has put the commitment to reduce reliance on coal-fired energy in direct tension with the new emphasis on energy security.“Chinese officials view coal as the primary guarantee of energy security,” said Anders Hove, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. “For this reason, it is now considered sensitive to criticise the country’s present investments in coal.”Local governments in China approved 50.4GW of new coal power in the first half of 2023. And in 2022, construction started on 50GW of coal capacity, an amount six times as large as the rest of the world combined.Despite growing demand for energy, China still has far more coal power capacity than it needs. Last year the average utilisation rate for coal power plants was just over 50%.Experts say that the way to ensure China’s energy security is to improve the technological infrastructure of the grid to make it more stable and efficient, not build new dirty generators.“Energy storage is the key for China’s energy transition,” said Gao Yuhe, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia. Energy storage can enable “renewable energy to take a leading role in the whole energy transition”.",

However, the World Bank will only apply the clauses to new loans, and the announcements do not add up to the debt forgiveness that some countries would like to see.Carly Munnelly, a senior adviser at Save the Children, said: “While such clauses are helpful, they are insufficient for addressing the crippling debt burdens faced by many countries today, which are undermining governments’ capacity to invest in children’s health, education and other rights.”Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, told the summit that the world needed not just reform but “absolute transformation” of the global financial system, to help developing countries emerge from poverty in a low-carbon way, and to cope with the impacts of the climate crisis.“That transformation is required because, while the world knew since the 1890s that we were facing warming of the climate, we chose not to heed the advice of scientists,” she said.At the summit, hosted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, countries and institutions unveiled a raft of measures to help raise finance, and assist poor countries.Several major economies, including France and Japan, will redirect tens of billions of dollars to the developing world, in the form of money known as “special drawing rights” under the International Monetary Fund.The EU called for an expansion of carbon trading, which it believes can raise a large proportion of the revenues needed for climate finance, in both developed and developing countries.The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, sought to reassure developing countries that focusing on the climate was not at the expense of lifting people out of poverty.",

As I’d missed the deadline, they were €287.88 each. My car is a leased Volkswagen Passat GTE (a petrol/electric hybrid) and is Euro 6 compliant, yet I’m facing a €1,727.28 bill. I tried repeatedly to challenge the fines, but each time the TfL website returned an error message, so I made an online representation to EPC, but have been told by TfL the fines still stand.AL, Braunschweig, GermanyThe Ulez, introduced in central London in 2019, and due to be expanded across Greater London in August, requires drivers of the most polluting vehicles to pay a daily charge. However, those from mainland Europe have been hit with fines amounting to thousands of euros, despite driving compliant cars.Vehicles from overseas must be pre-registered with TfL before entering the zone, otherwise they may be deemed non-compliant. In 2022, 167,663 fines were sent overseas. Unluckily for you, EPC, which enforces them, recently gained access to vehicle-keeper records in Germany, the Netherlands and France, and has been making up for lost time by firing off PCNs for alleged offences months previously.Amazingly, there is no legal cut-off after which PCNs cannot be issued. By the time they reach drivers (in your case via the leasing company, which caused added delays), they have rocketed, for one couple to £3,589 after a trip to London.TfL says the registration process for foreign vehicles is on its website, but you’d have to know of the requirement to look.",

Half a dozen bats burst out from their hiding places in the rare wet woodland, dipping and diving merrily through the darkening evening sky.With impeccable timing, a punt full of tourists on a “bat safari” glides into view. The tiny 2.2 hectare reserve protects the river corridor between Cambridge city centre and Grantchester Meadows and boasts eight species of bat, including the rare and endangered barbastelle, along with voles, herons, kingfishers and otters. Renowned locally for its muddy paths past canopies of mature willow and alder trees, rich marshland and unique riparian habitats, it has been popular with Cambridge students, college dons and the town’s nature-lovers for centuries.Now a local conservation group, Friends of Paradise Nature Reserve, fears the tranquillity and biodiversity of this local oasis is under threat. One of the Cambridge colleges, Queens’ College, is proposing to build postgraduate student accommodation on a neighbouring lawn it owns at the boundary of the reserve.Kingfishers are a common sight at the reserve. Photograph: Chris Grady/AlamyThe college is appealing against a unanimous decision by the Labour-run city council to reject its proposal – which was initially recommended for planning approval in January – after almost 200 people objected to the development and 2,400 people signed a petition against it.“We fear that the height, scale and massing of three-storey buildings so close to the boundary would have a harmful impact on both the ecological and amenity value of the reserve,” said Pam Gatrell, chair of Friends of Paradise, which is crowdfunding to raise £30,000 to pay for ecology consultants and legal advice to protect the reserve.MapIn its planning application, Queens’ College pointed out that as the University of Cambridge is seeking to grow its postgraduate numbers by 1% per annum, there is “very clearly a need for postgraduate housing for Queens’ College”. “Making best use of college-owned sites prevents the need for the college to seek to acquire private housing in the city,” the application states, adding that this would help protect existing private housing provision in the city.",

The combined figured surpassed the £179.8m spent on upgrading infrastructure – from replacing pipes to improving water supplies – from 2020 to 2022, the Financial Times reported.David Hall, a visiting professor at Greenwich University, told the FT that the potential for shortages in south-east England had been “known about for a long time but had not been dealt with due to bad planning, a failure to cut leakage and a decision to divert money towards dividends rather than investing in infrastructure”.South East Water, which has 2.2 million customers, said it is “prioritising projects across its system to increase the amount of water that we can supply” and that it had invested nearly £500m in its network over the past five years. It said no dividends had reached its ultimate parent company, HDF (UK) Holdings and it does not expect to pay a dividend this year or next.Of the £156m in dividends, £136m was through a regulator-approved payout used to pay off an internal loan to its parent company in 2020 and the remainder was used to pay interest on debts within the group.

Exposure to these tiny particles dominates the health harm from air pollution and is the leading environment risk factor for early death. PM2.5 comes from the burning of solid and liquid fuels, through power generation, domestic heating and motor traffic. It can also form in the air from chemical reactions between other pollutants.A growing body of research shows that these particulates are responsible for a huge range of health problems from lung and heart disease to diabetes and cancer, brain function to premature births. As well as leaving millions of people with life-limiting chronic health conditions, they also lead to the early death of more than 400,000 people across Europe each year. Experts say more than 200,000 of these could be saved if the air in Europe met World Health Organization guidelines.The current WHO guidelines state that annual average concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms a cubic metre (µg/m3).Gary FullerWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The underlying data for the Guardian’s air pollution in Europe investigation is sourced from the Expanse project, coordinated by the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, the Netherlands, with air quality modelling conducted in collaboration between Utrecht University and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute.The project employed various data sources, including road data, land use data, satellite air pollution retrievals, chemical transport model estimates and meteorological information, which were employed as input for the air quality modelling. The data, methodology and resulting interactive were shared with air pollution scientist Dr Gary Fuller for verification.To account for the dispersion of air pollution, the researchers calculated several variables within circular buffer sizes ranging from 50 to 10,000 metres. Once the buffered values were determined, all predictor maps were re-gridded to a resolution of 25 metres. Regression analysis was subsequently conducted between these predictors and routine exposure data for NO2 and PM2.5 obtained from the European Environmental Agency (2000 to 2019 inclusive).",

Last year, yields on crops such as cabbage and kale were reduced because of the drought.The National Drought Group has warned that England is one hot, dry spell away from severe drought conditions returning in 2023. Two areas – East Anglia and Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly – are still in official “drought” status, with the remainder now “recovering”.

That could mean trouble not just for people but for some of the region’s plants, too.Residents across the sprawling metro are finding the extended extreme heat has led to fried flora. Nurseries and landscapers are inundated with requests for help with saguaros or fruit trees that are losing leaves.Phones have been “ringing nonstop” about everything from a cactus to a citrus tree or ficus, said Sophia Booth, a landscape designer at Moon Valley Nursery. “A lot of people are calling and saying their cactus is yellowing really hard, fell over or like broken arms, that sort of thing. Twenty-year-old trees are losing all their leaves, or they’re turning a crisp brown.”At the Desert Botanical Garden, three of the treasured institution’s more than 1,000 saguaro cactuses have toppled over or lost an arm in the last week, a rate that officials there say is highly unusual.These saguaros, a towering trademark of the Sonoran Desert landscape, were already stressed from record-breaking heat three years ago, and this summer’s historic heat – the average temperature in Phoenix last month was 102.7F (39.3C) – turned out to be the cactus needle that broke the camel’s back.Saguaros can live up to 200 years and grow as tall as 40ft (12 meters). Some in the Desert Botanical Garden date beyond its opening 85 years ago, and the largest there measure almost 30ft (9 meters), according to Kimberlie McCue, the garden’s chief science officer.People commonly assume that cactuses are made to endure scorching heat, but even they can have their limits, McCue said. It wasn’t just this summer’s 31-day streak of highs at or above 110F (43.3C), but also the multiple nights when the low never dipped below 90F (32.2C). Night-time is when cactuses open their pores to get rid of retained water and take in carbon dioxide, she explained.There is hope that the arrival of thunderstorms during the monsoon season, which traditionally starts on 15 June, could bring more delayed moisture that will help struggling flora.In Arizona, about half the rain that falls during the year comes during the monsoon.",

Levels in central New York were deemed “hazardous” – the worst level on the EPA’s index for air quality reporting – while Philadelphia was placed under a “code red” as the air quality index soared to its highest level since 2008.Exposure to smoke can trigger an array of health problems, experts say, but there are ways residents can keep themselves safe.Staying inside and especially refraining from strenuous outdoor activity is an important way to limit exposure, said Laura Kate Bender, the national assistant vice-president of the healthy air program at the American Lung Association.If one must go outside, experts suggest wearing a mask – preferably an N95 or equivalent.Keeping indoor air clean by closing windows and doors is also helpful, as is turning on air purification devices when possible. (The Environmental Protection Agency does not certify air purifiers, but California regulators recommend these models.)Wildfire smoke is made up of a cocktail of irritants, including gaseous pollutants like carbon monoxide and hazardous air pollutants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Most concerning, it can include pollution particles known as fine particulate matter or PM2.5, which are so tiny that they can enter the bloodstream when breathed in.The smoke can create an array of health problems, including shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing and eye irritation, especially for at-risk groups.People with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other respiratory issues are particularly vulnerable, as are children, who breathe in more air because their lungs are still developing.Pregnant people can have diminished lung capacities, making them more vulnerable to wildfire smoke as well. Exposure to air pollution has also been linked to gestational diabetes, preterm birth and even stillbirth.Other vulnerable groups include those with a “significant chronic disease”, said Kimberly Humphrey, climate change and human health fellow at the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.",

Activists, however, equated it to asking “arms dealers to lead peace talks” when authorities announced his nomination on Thursday.“I think that Dr Sultan al-Jaber is a terrific choice because he is the head of the company. That company knows it needs to transition,” Kerry said after attending an energy conference in the Emirati capital. “He knows – and the leadership of the UAE is committed to transitioning.”Still, Abu Dhabi plans to increase its production of crude oil from 4m barrels a day up to 5m even while the UAE promises to be carbon neutral by 2050 – a target that remains difficult to assess and one that the Emirates still hasn’t fully explained how it will reach.Kerry pointed to a speech al-Jaber gave Saturday in Abu Dhabi, in which he called for the upcoming Cop – or Conference of Parties – to move “from goals to getting it done across mitigation, adaptation, finance and loss and damage”. Al-Jaber also warned that the world “must be honest with ourselves about how much progress we have actually achieved, and how much further and faster we truly need to go”.“He made it absolutely clear we’re not moving fast enough. We have to reduce emissions. We have to begin to accelerate this transition significantly,” Kerry said. “So I have great confidence that the right issues are going to be on the table, that they’re going to respond to them and lead countries to recognize their responsibility.”Each year, the country hosting the UN negotiations nominates a person to chair the talks.

It appears to be built on an alluvial fan – a cone-shaped feature of the landscape, formed over millennia by sediment deposition from the river. These features form where steep rivers exit mountain upland, spread out and split into a series of distributary channels down the fan (like a delta).In many cases around the world, as in Derna, the water flow has been engineered into a single, embanked channel on one flank of the fan and building allowed right up to its margins. In an extreme event, as has happened here, the enormous water flow has reverted to its natural pathways, overflowing the constrained channel and flowing in multiple pathways down the fan feature on which most of the town is built.Such locations are particularly vulnerable to the effects of extreme flows, and demonstrate the dangers of trying to control nature by large-scale channel diversion and embanking. It is essential, especially with climate change, that natural settings and situations are recognised and that we work with nature much more to manage floods and rivers sustainably.Prof Janet HookeUniversity of Liverpool On 2 November 1925, the Eigiau dam in north Wales broke, releasing 70m tons of water down the valley. Ten adults and six children were killed. Since then, no deaths have resulted from UK dam breaks. There are more than 2,000 reservoirs in the UK that contain over 25,000 cubic metres of water. It is shocking to see how many buildings today are at risk from dam breach inundation on the flood-risk maps on the government’s website.Planning permissions are still routinely given for new developments on floodplains and in dam breach shadow zones.

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The plan was to build a 1.4GW power station on a cattle property near the mining town of Alpha in the Galilee Basin.Initially Waratah Coal lodged a development application for the $3.5bn plant with the Barcaldine regional council, rather than the Queensland government. In 2021 the state exercised “call in” power to assess the project.The company has had approval since 2013 to build a 40m tonne coalmine 30km north of Alpha – population 335 – and 450km west of Rockhampton. It has taken no steps to begin mining.The Department of Environment and Science said the coal power station, if approved, would be the among the 100 biggest carbon polluters in Australia and the second-largest source of scope one emissions in Queensland. Based on 2019 figures, it would increase the state’s emissions by about 5.73%.",

Since Roman times, creamy-white Carrara marble has been dug out of these mountains. It is the most sought-after marble in the world, and has inspired artists and architects everywhere.The Italian alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris apuana). Photograph: Manuel MicheliBut the Apuan Alps also host an ecosystem that is home to the Italian alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris apuana). In November, Manuel Micheli, a photographer working with the Apuane Libere organisation, stumbled across the newt in Crespina 2, a decommissioned quarry.“Between my feet, I found a small newt out of the water. Looking closer, I saw several dozen of them,” he says. The newt is protected by Italian law and categorised as “near threatened” on the IUCN red list of threatened species.“It was incredible to discover such a group,” says Gianluca Briccolani, the co-founder of Apuane Libere, a volunteer organisation formed in 2021 to protect the mountains from environmental degradation, including water contamination caused by the heavy industrialisation of the marble industry.A volunteer from Apuane Libere waves the group’s flag above a quarry in Carrara, Italy. Photograph: Manuel MicheliCava Crespina 2 lies under Monte Sagro and overlooks the Mediterranean. It was closed in 2014 and became a perfect place for newt reproduction thanks to an underground spring and rainwater filtration in conjunction with the lake’s impermeabilisation, caused by marble dust waste (marmettola).Since Micheli’s discovery, the newt population has grown – and the scientific and local community has mobilised to protect the newts. Plans to reopen the quarry were halted earlier this month by Unesco and the Apuan Park.“Last year, we counted at least three dozen newts in different life stages,” says the herpetologist Gabriele Martinucci. “This was a sensational discovery because it means they live in the quarry throughout the entire year. It’s a demonstration that, even in places transformed by industrial activities, nature can give life to something that wasn’t there, such as the newts.” But campaigners worry that the quarry could be reopened in the future.",

One advert that ran in April stated: “Labour have done nothing for you other than spend millions on trying to tax you to drive with Greens and Lib Dems.”The start date for a Manchester CAZ, which would be the UK’s largest outside of London, has been delayed after disagreements between the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and the government over funding.Area breakdownMisinformation about the Manchester CAZ has been widely shared on Facebook, according to separate analysis using the analytics tool Crowdtangle.The most popular organic post mentioning the scheme claimed that authorities had cut down trees by a motorway junction near Wigan in order to install CAZ signage. The post later received 43,000 interactions on Facebook when it was reposted by a meme page.A spokesperson for Highways England, which manages the land around the Orrell Interchange, said no trees had been removed to install the sign.Trafford Conservatives said in a statement: “On Thursday, voters in Trafford have a choice.",

        "text": "In his 1968 essay The Tragedy of the Commons, the ecologist Garrett Hardin argued that resources which do not clearly belong to anyone are likely to be overexploited, since protecting them is in no one person’s interest. That tragedy is unfolding on the high seas – the two-thirds of the ocean that lies beyond coastal states’ national jurisdiction. This is a commons, where fishing and mining have been opened to all. The result is serious damage to a vital resource that covers almost half the planet’s surface. The high seas are not entirely lawless. Yet only a tiny fraction of these waters are protected from exploitation, despite harbouring the world’s marine wilderness and its unique biodiversity.Beneath the waves lies a rich prize. Many scientists think the high seas harbour novel disease-fighting chemistry that might lead to new drugs. Until this month, there was no mechanism to prevent nations or companies monopolising the world’s marine genetic resources. One study in 2018 pointed out that BASF, which calls itself “the largest chemical producer in the world”, owned nearly half of the 13,000 patents derived from marine organisms. Mining exploration licences in the Pacific alone span an area almost as wide as the US. If deep sea extraction were permitted to go ahead, many warn, it would lead to biodiversity loss on an enormous scale.The good news is that the agreement of a historic UN ocean treaty this month may help to slow the plunder. Crucially the deal keeps alive the 30x30 target – a pledge made by countries at the UN biodiversity conference in December that aims to protect 30% of sea (and land) by 2030. The treaty tries to accommodate both the global north’s desire for a legal framework for establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) to protect against the loss of wildlife and the global south’s expectation that resources are seen as being common to all.All this arrives not a moment too soon. The oceans are not an inexhaustible resource. Yet humanity treats them as if they are boundless. There are limits to how many animals and plants can be sustainably harvested for food and other products.",

They mean that the budget set in the government’s contracts for difference auction is unlikely to be spent, because many windfarms will not get through the auction, so bills will be kept higher.Despite the fact that the government recently increased the budget for the auction from £170m to £190m, analysts at the ECIU said this was likely to make little difference to the outcome of the auction and ignored the fact that renewables were predicted to save customers money.The previous auction round did not meet the budget and previous analysis found that 1GW of wind power was missed out on, along with savings of £225m a year. The ECIU found that the current auction could secure as little as about 2GW of offshore wind, leading to missed savings of more than £1.5bn a year from cheaper renewable energy, compared with about 7GW that could have been secured.Energy experts have criticised the government for giving tax breaks to oil companies and not allowing windfarms to thrive.Jess Ralston, an energy analyst at the ECIU, said: “The government seems to be focused on North Sea gas licences and tax breaks for oil companies that won’t bring down bills, while tying up offshore wind farms that generate electricity cheaper than gas in red tape. What is going on?“Even with inflation pushing costs up for offshore wind, it will still generate electricity much cheaper than gas power stations. Stifling windfarms pushes up bills. The Treasury’s rules seem to be actively working against bringing them down.”If the rules around these auctions were not loosened, the ECIU said, it could put the goal of 50GW of offshore wind by 2030 at risk.",

However, since being appointed to cabinet he has remained quiet.A source close to Hunt said he could not comment on cases subject to judicial review as a government minister, but that his views on the project as a constituency MP are a matter of public record.After the decision, Hunt tweeted: “I am bitterly disappointed to learn that the court of appeal has today refused permission for any further appeal against the Ukog planning consent for the Loxley gas well outside Dunsfold. I stand ready to provide my assistance and support to local communities in any way possible going forwards.”Hunt is under pressure from the Liberal Democrats in his South West Surrey constituency, where he has a majority of 8,000. The local environmental issue has angered many of his constituents, who have complained about the noise and environmental impacts of drilling for gas near the Surrey Hills area of outstanding natural beauty.The Liberal Democrats environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: “This is a shameful outcome.

They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because most do not degrade in the environment.A 2019 state consent order required Chemours to rein in its Fayetteville Works’ site pollution for PFAS compounds produced or released from the facility. But most PFAS tests can only identify a limited number of PFAS.Chemours, which was spun off from DuPont in 2015 to shield the latter from legal liability, is thought to be responsible for contaminating the air, soil, crops and water across potentially hundreds of square miles of south-east North Carolina with PFAS waste, according to public health advocates, regulators and researchers.Many residents allege it has sickened people on a wide scale; a judge recently allowed more than 100,000 residents to move forward with a class-action PFAS lawsuit against DuPont and Chemours and the United Nations has been urged to investigate alleged human rights violations over the company’s pollution.Researchers identified the PFAS compounds downstream from Fayetteville Works, but did not find them in a lake upstream from the plant, suggesting they were produced by Chemours. Some of the compounds are similar in structure to PFAS produced at Fayetteville Works, but others are highly unusual, Baker said.",

Then, one after another, the heads of Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP all repeated that no, they had never approved any such effort.Here’s the problem: that’s a lie.There can be no doubt that Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP have all engaged in false advertising, aka disinformation campaigns, during the tenure of their current CEOs. In fact, one could argue that the vast majority of the industry’s advertising fits this definition.Take Exxon. For years, Exxon has been spending millions of dollars to run ads about its investments in algae fuel, even though it has spent very little on the actual research and has no plan to bring the product to market. The company hopes to create a “net impression” among consumers that Exxon is in the business of climate solutions, when it’s really still in the business of climate destruction.

In the 2020 ad “Butterfly,” Chevron highlighted its commitment to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as a climate solution. According to the New York Times, however, Chevron is only spending “pocket change” on these technologies as it “doubles down” on oil and gas production. Worse yet: the technology Chevron is touting doesn’t actually work. Chevron’s largest CCS project in Australia has been “a disaster from the beginning” and is now just venting CO2 into the atmosphere.Shell provides a company-wide example.

If the trends continue, the heat could become too much for the sensitive amphibians to survive successfully, researchers have said.The call of the coquí frog is well known to most who have spent time in Puerto Rico. It is named for its two-note call “co-qui”, which rings out throughout the island every night.Fears for England’s frog and toad population after droughtRead moreMale coquí frogs use their distinctive call to mark their territory and warn off rivals, but scientists have noticed that it is changing.Peter Narins of the University of California, Los Angeles, has been studying their croaks for 23 years. While recording the sounds along the slopes of El Yunque mountain in Puerto Rico, he and his team found that the calls changed depending on the altitude of the frogs.Amphibians are very sensitive to changes in temperature, and the higher on the mountains they were, the cooler it was. The frogs on the mountain peaks, therefore, were found to be larger than ones sitting in warm valleys, and this meant their call was different.Nairns said: “Coquí that produced short, high-pitched calls at high rates lived near the base of the mountain, while the calls of animals living near the mountain’s peak were longer, lower-pitched, and repeated less frequently.”Two decades after first recording their sound, Nairns returned to the mountains with a colleague, Sebastiaan Meenderink. The pair found that every frog call, no matter where it was on the mountain, had become higher pitched.“In order to record a call with certain characteristics we had to move to a slightly higher altitude,” said Meenderink. “It was as if all the animals had moved up the mountain.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

Many of these journeys have been called “polluting and pointless” by Greenpeace, as they are so short they could have easily been taken by train – and in one case, cycled in 30 minutes.The analysis by the Dutch environmental consultancy CE Delft also found that the number of private jets taking off from the UK increased by 75% between 2021 and 2022 to 90,256 flights, emitting 500,000 tonnes of CO2 – more than in any other European country.The UK tops all league tables for private jets, boasting the busiest route, the most polluting route and the most flights overall. Flights between London and Paris were the most popular route, accounting for 3,357 flights, and six of the top 10 routes overall also included London.Map showing private jet routesAccording to a Transport & Environment study, private jets are five to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes per passenger, and 50 times more polluting than trains. Previous research found that 50% of all aviation emissions were caused by 1% of the world’s population.The use of private jets appears to be rising. The research found that private jet traffic across Europe rose from 350,000 flights in 2021 to more than 570,000 in 2022, with a heavy impact on emissions. The associated CO2 emissions more than doubled over the same period to more than 3.3m tonnes.Environmental campaigners at Greenpeace are calling for a ban on private jet travel, highlighting that the research shows almost one-in-four (39%) private jet flights in Europe were considered “very short-haul” meaning they were less than 310 miles (500km) and could easily have been train trips.There were also some staggeringly inefficient routes found in the analysis. A flight between Blackbushe and Farnborough in Hampshire – which is just 4.6 miles (7.4km) – topped the charts for the most carbon-intensive route in 2021 and 2022.",

It beat the previous September record by 0.5C, the largest jump in temperature ever seen.In the UK, where the summer was wet and many people have enjoyed unseasonably warm early autumn days, the disruption has not been anything like as destructive as elsewhere. But floods, fires and exceptionally high temperatures are becoming more and more frequent – with the overflow of Lhonak Lake in India, and the wildfires and baking heat in Tenerife among the latest emergencies.The countdown to the latest round of UN climate talks, which start in Dubai in late November, has begun. On Wednesday, Pope Francis issued an update to his 2015 encyclical – a document he addressed to “every person living” – warning that “the world in which we live is collapsing” and calling for “irresponsible” western lifestyles to change. More than 80 countries are pushing for a phaseout of fossil fuels to be on the Cop28 agenda. But leaders of the biggest-emitting countries, including Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, were absent from a summit convened by António Guterres, the UN secretary general, in New York last month.As Mr Guterres has warned, oil companies and states are lobbying hard against attempts to close down their businesses. Saudi Arabia’s huge recent investment in football is part of a strategy aimed at increasing its influence and muting opponents.

BHP, which maintains coal interests but this year sold its petroleum assets to Woodside, had 44 and was linked to another seven through an associated entity, the BHP-Mitsubishi Alliance.The list was compiled by author Penny Tangey and expanded by the climate group 350.org. Guardian Australia verified the entries on an earlier version of the list that recorded 350 sponsorships.Belinda Noble, from ComsDeclare, a group of Australian public relations professionals campaigning for a fossil fuel ad ban, said the deals were about building influence.“It’s a subtle way of trying to engineer social support, or continued social support, for these polluting products,” she said. “Most of these companies don’t sell to the general population. There’s no reason for them to be spending millions of dollars on sports and arts sponsorships. What they’re trying to do is sell their brand.”Woodside and Santos were asked for their response. A spokesperson for BHP said the coal from its mines was used in steelmaking, in which there are fewer commercially viable alternatives, and not power generation. They said the company spent $106m in partnerships with more than 250 organisations in Australia during the last financial year.“Through these investments we aim to make contributions that are community-led, relevant and important to the regions where we operate, where many of our employees live and our local suppliers are based,” the BHP spokesperson said.The terms of sponsorship deals are rarely public and are often covered by non-disclosure agreements. Depending on the organisation and the type of partnership, some are thought to be worth a few thousand dollars. Others, including naming rights deals on major venues or events, can run into the millions.",

It is also fundamental for us,” she said.“Our results suggest a level of consciousness [in chickens] that prompts discussions about animal rights and welfare.”Writing in the journal Plos One, Hillemacher and colleagues note that roosters tend to call out to their peers should they see an aerial threat, such as a bird of prey. If a rooster is alone, however, it does not usually raise the alarm as it could draw the predator’s attention.In their first set of experiments, the team placed a rooster in one of two sections of an indoor space. In the other section they placed either a mirror, another rooster, or left it empty.The team then projected the silhouette of a flying hawk on to the ceiling of the section containing the first rooster.The results from 58 roosters revealed the birds made far more alarm calls when another rooster was visible to them, with 1.33 alarm calls per bird on average over three tests, than when alone (0.29 calls on average) or faced with the mirror (0.43 calls on average). The team found a similar reduction in calls when they placed a second rooster out of sight behind the mirror.The team say the findings suggest the birds did not regard their reflection as another rooster, even when accompanied by the smell and sound of a second bird. While that may suggest roosters can recognise themselves in a mirror, the team say there is another possibility.",

Building gigafactories is seen as a key aim by the UK government, which pledged £100m in financial support to the project.Rishi Sunak restarts talks on London listing for UK tech firm ArmRead moreBritishvolt’s site, near Blyth in Northumberland, is seen by many in the automotive industry as one of the UK’s best potential locations for a gigafactory because of proximity to power lines carrying renewable energy and a deep-sea port. However, the startup reached the brink of collapse in October as it ran out of money, with building work on the factory mostly halted since the summer.Under the terms of the rescue deal, the investors will pay £30m for 95% of the business – a deal that would leave existing shareholders including co-founder Orral Nadjari and FTSE 100 companies Glencore and Ashtead with 5% of the business worth less than £2m. The consortium would then commit a further £128m to fund the next stage in Britishvolt’s plan.The deal was organised by Somerley Capital, a Hong Kong-based corporate finance adviser.

The analysis of climate data released by WaterAid and Cardiff and Bristol universities finds that under extreme climate pressures, areas that used to experience frequent droughts are now more prone to frequent flooding, while other regions historically prone to flooding now endure more frequent droughts.The southern Shabelle region of Ethiopia, which between 1980 and 2000 experienced numerous periods of flooding, is exhibiting a shift towards prolonged and severe drought, the analysis, published on Tuesday, shows. The Shabelle River, which is a major water source for Somalia, recently experienced the worst of the drought conditions in the Horn of Africa. The increased droughts are mirrored in northern Italy, and the research shows the number of intense dry spells experienced by both areas has more than doubled since 2000.But as part of what researchers describe as a “climate hazard flip”, the droughts in both regions are punctuated by extreme rainfall causing devastating flooding, which was experienced in the Lombardy region of Italy this summer.The research examined the frequency and magnitude of flooding and drought hazards over the past 41 years in locations across six countries: Pakistan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mozambique. Italy was included as a European comparison.Children are moved across a flooded area in a satellite dish after heavy monsoon rainfalls in Jaffarabad district, Pakistan, in 2022.

Now, scientists are warning that it is at risk of extinction and calling for action to save it.The blooms of the Rafflesia have become famous for their odour of decaying meat, produced to attract flesh-eating flies. But the genus – which includes the largest flowers in the world, at more than a metre across – is at risk due to the destruction of forest habitats in south-east Asia. There are 42 species of Rafflesia, and researchers warn that all of them are under threat, with 25 classified as critically endangered and 15 as endangered.More than two-thirds are not being protected by current conservation strategies, according to a new study published in the journal Plants, People, Planet. It is the first global assessment of the threats facing these plants.Chris Thorogood, an author of the study, with Rafflesia arnoldii, the largest flower in the world, in Sumatra. Photograph: Dr Chris ThorogoodDr Chris Thorogood, from the University of Oxford Botanic Garden, an author of the study, said the study “highlights how the global conservation efforts geared towards plants – however iconic – have lagged behind those of animals”.“We urgently need a joined-up, cross-regional approach to save some of the world’s most remarkable flowers, most of which are now on the brink of being lost,” he said.Due to their being largely hidden throughout their life cycle, the flowers are poorly understood, with new species still being found. Many populations are believed to contain only a few hundred individuals. “Alarmingly, recent observations suggest taxa are still being eradicated before they are even known to science,” researchers warn in the paper.Rafflesia is a parasitic plant that has no leaves, stems or roots, and does not photosynthesise. Instead, it uses long filaments that look like fungal cells to extract food and water from tropical jungle vines across Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Rafflesia spends most of its life hidden within the vine, but then produces a cabbage-like bud that turns into a giant rubbery flower. The flower pollinates via a thick, sticky liquid that dries on to flies.",

Jennings is planning to erect signs along the river to alert the public to the discharges.The signs read: “You are advised to avoid contact with the river water and suggest you keep pets and livestock out of the river.” The signs inform the public to contact the Environment Agency if they see dead wildlife on or around the river.Chalk streams are a haven for species like the otter, kingfisher, salmon and trout. Jennings said the problem of excessive discharges into the river dated back to 2014, and the Environment Agency was aware of the issue.Jennings said the sewage discharges were a result of four breaches in the system, of which Thames Water was aware. “The Environment Agency told Thames Water in 2014 and in 2020 to do something about this, that there was a problem here with groundwater ingress. But more than six years later, here we are in 2021 and it is still happening.”A spokesperson for Thames Water said groundwater ingress was the problem. The company said it had set up CCTV to inspect the sewer pipes in the area and gather evidence of how the groundwater was getting into the sewage system. It planned to use the detail from the cameras, to get the funding required to reline the pipes.“Our view is that discharges of untreated sewage are unacceptable, even when they are legally permitted, and we want to accelerate work to stop them being necessary,” the spokesperson said.",

But machinery makers are falling over themselves to get a slice of a much more unlikely advertising vehicle: the Farming Simulator video game.The developer, Giants Software, now receives hundreds of queries a year from manufacturers of equipment – from tractors and combine harvesters to trailers, balers and seed drills – about how they can feature in the game, where players create their own virtual farm.Farming Simulator is important enough that some firms even launch products at the same time as the game is updated. Search for news about Göweil, and you’re just as likely to find details of the nine products in the Farming Simulator update pack released last week as coverage of its hay balers in the real world.Giants, based in Switzerland, told the Observer that interest from manufacturers provides it with enough of a revenue stream to cover the costs of game development. “In the beginning, we had to ask manufacturers to be included in the game,” said Wolfgang Ebert, Giants’ marketing manager. “Today, we have to consider who we can integrate and what benefit there is to the game – we have many, many brands waiting to be included.”Players begin with a barn, some equipment and a little land. They need to grow food, sell it, expand their farm – and buy better gear.Part of the appeal of the Farming Simulator series, like Microsoft Flight Simulator or the Formula One racing games, comes from the realism of the experience. Yet would-be pilots and drivers are unlikely to be able to afford a jumbo jet or a racing car, while there are plenty of farmers who have bought one of the 25m copies sold who can potentially field-test a new tractor in the game, making it a much more valuable marketing tool.Companies now share detailed engineering drawings of their product with Giants so that it can be simulated – a highly sensitive matter, according to Martin Seidel, the partner manager for Giants. “We definitely have to have good relationships with everyone, because we’re on a high trust level,” he said.",

Cocoa, its most important ingredient, is produced from the seed of the tropical Theobroma cacao tree. It is native to South America, but most is now produced in Africa, with Ivory Coast and Ghana accounting for two-thirds of production.An estimated 2 million farmers in west Africa, operating farms of an average of just three to four hectares each, rely on cocoa for their income – usually less than $1 a day. They supply a complex network of middlemen, including public and private companies, who connect them to the world market, making the supply chain opaque.This obscurity has made cocoa production a haven for human rights abuses, and chocolate has long been linked to slavery. But the latest research also links the indulgent snack to the climate and biodiversity crises that risk the catastrophic breakdown of the planet’s biosphere.Like tropical regions, west Africa is rapidly losing its forests. Ivory Coast is estimated to have lost more than 90% since 1950, while Ghana is thought to have lost at least 65%. Cocoa production had been identified as one of the main causes of deforestation in both countries, alongside mining, selective logging and other agriculture, but the extent to which it bore responsibility was not certain.An international team of researchers set out to accurately map the extent of cocoa cultivation in deforested areas using satellite imagery.

Not being fully transparent with the board of directors – whether about past personal relationships with colleagues or anything else – usually has that outcome for a chief executive. On the company’s version of events, this was clearly a resigning matter.The immediate question is succession. BP is the type of company that likes to promote from within and, with the 53-year-old Looney at the helm, the board probably thought it had a few more years to observe the internal jostling for position.Murray Auchincloss, the chief financial officer, who has got the gig on an interim basis, is the leading contender, but energy companies usually prefer their permanent chief executives to have more frontline operational experience. City analysts speculated that the chair, Helge Lund, who was chief executive of BG Group until the gas firm was bought by Shell in 2016, would fit the bill. That feels unlikely. Lund presumably wouldn’t have opted for the non-executive life post-BG if he still wished to be a day-to-day boss.As importantly, the appointment process will reignite the debate about the pace of BP’s transition towards net zero by 2050 “or sooner”. Looney himself wobbled – or so it seemed – in February when he scrapped the target of reducing hydrocarbon output by 40% by 2030 and opted for 25%.On the other hand, he stuck to his original plan for BP to have 50 gigawatts of wind and solar generating capacity by 2030 while simultaneously revving up other “transition growth engines” such as biofuels, electric charging points and hydrogen. Even after the softening of hydrocarbon targets, BP is perceived within the big oil universe as a faster transitioner than Shell and positively speedy versus unashamedly oily US majors such as Chevron and ExxonMobil.But, in an age of sharply higher oil and gas prices, Exxon and Chevron shares have flown and BP’s haven’t. The stock market has rewarded purer fossil fuels producers over companies pushing into zero-carbon generation (albeit BP is still projected to have 75% of its earnings from fossil fuels in 2030).",

New measures to counter emissions of nitrogen oxides and other air pollutants will also be needed for buildings, heating plants and many other domestic and industrial sources in future.The warning follows the controversy that has surrounded London’s ultra low emission zone (Ulez) in which drivers are charged for their vehicles’ polluting impact. This month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will expand the zone from inner London so it covers all boroughs in the city. The decision has provoked opposition from some drivers and was blamed by various Labour party figures for the Conservatives surprise byelection win in Uxbridge and South Ruislip last month.But scientists at the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories at the University of York last week stressed the need to maintain air quality, particularly in cities. “Air pollution is one of the highest causes of preventable death in the UK,” Prof Alastair Lewis told the Observer last week.“The National Health Service is run at full stretch all the time, so every extra medical problem has a disproportionate effect. The crucial point is that it may be hard to make people eat healthy foods or not drink too much alcohol, but it is easy to make them breathe in clear air – as long as you provide it.”In London, there is very little difference between air quality in the inner city and in its outer boroughs – at present. Both have pollution levels that are far higher than those set as safe standards by the World Health Organization.However, the York team said they expected air quality to improve fairly rapidly in London’s outer areas as the extension of the city’s Ulez takes effect. But in the central area it will remain relatively high.Part of the problem lies with the greater congestion of the inner city. Vehicles emit more pollutants when braking and accelerating than they do when travelling at a steady speed.",

The climate crisis is posing an existential threat to these colonies, as sea ice is rapidly melting.“This is an exciting discovery,” said Dr Peter Fretwell, of the British Antarctic Survey, who led the research. “[But] like many of the recently discovered sites, this colony is small and in a region badly affected by recent sea ice loss.”Photo issued by British Antarctic Survey of an emperor penguin colony that has been discovered in Antarctica using satellite mapping technology. Photograph: Maxar Technologies 2023/BAS/PAEmperor penguins are the only penguins that breed on sea ice, rather than land, and are located in areas that are very difficult to study because they are remote, inaccessible and can experience temperatures as low as −60C. For the last 15 years, British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists have been looking for new colonies by searching satellite imagery for tell-tale brown guano stains (penguin poo) on the ice.The latest colony, at Verleger Point, in west Antarctica, was discovered based on images from the European Commission’s Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite mission, and confirmed on high resolution images from the Maxar WorldView-3 satellite.World faces ‘terminal’ loss of Arctic sea ice during summers, report warnsRead morePenguins need the ice to last between April and September to give the chicks time to grow more robust, making them particularly vulnerable to climate breakdown. “If the ice breaks up before that, the chicks fall into the water and drown or freeze,” said Fretwell.The size of penguin colonies also has a direct impact on their survival as the birds huddle together for protection against winter storms, particularly during the two-month period in which the male penguins incubate the eggs before they hatch.Colonies have already been lost due to changes in sea ice, including one at Marguerite Bay that had been studied since the 1940s, and another in Halley Bay that had been stable for 50 years.",

The poles will take a little longer – the ozone layer will fully bounce back by 2045 over the Arctic and by 2066 over the Antarctic.Following alarm over the loss of ozone in the 1980s, the ozone layer has been steadily improving in the wake of the 1989 Montreal protocol, an international agreement that has helped eliminate 99% of ozone-depleting chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that were used as solvents and refrigerants.The UN said the action taken on the ozone layer had also bolstered the more ponderous response to the climate crisis – CFCs are also greenhouse gases and their continued uncontrolled use would have raised global temperatures by as much as 1C by the middle of the century, worsening an already dire situation where planet-heating gases are still not declining.“Ozone action sets a precedent for climate action,” said Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, which unveiled the progress report, which is conducted every four years, on Monday. “Our success in phasing out ozone-eating chemicals shows us what can and must be done as a matter of urgency to transition away from fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gases and so limit temperature increase.”The unified global response to dealing with CFCs means that the Montreal agreement should be considered “the most successful environmental treaty in history and offers encouragement that countries of the world can come together and decide an outcome and act on it”, according to David Fahey, a scientist at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is a lead author of the new assessment.",

This will have been news to much of the public, particularly those who remember the long years of Conservative austerity after 2010 and the Tory party’s self‑expulsion of Britain from the European Union after 2016. Neither of these dominant events of the last 13 years was a flagship social democratic policy last time we looked.Yet Ms Truss is almost right in one respect. The British public has been moving slowly and steadily in a more social democratic direction in recent years. The publication this week of the 40th annual British Social Attitudes survey provides some of the evidence. It reveals, for instance, that the public does not only want government to fund health care and pensions, it also wants it to reduce income differences between the rich and the poor. The public supports further increases in taxes and spending in order to fund public services too, in spite of the fact that taxes are already high by historic standards.These are significant findings. As the blogger Sam Freedman pointed out this week, they result from observable, real world changes like the growth of food bank poverty, not some elite conspiracy. The implications for Labour are therefore encouraging. They suggest that there is some space for a new government to tax and spend more in pursuit of some of its priorities. Parts of the net zero agenda that has dominated the news in the last few days are an obvious example. But this will only be the case as long as the public agrees with the priority and trusts the government to spend wisely and fairly.Attitude surveys always need to be invoked with care. They do not provide governments with a carte blanche. Although majorities identify with the more progressive views quoted above, this is not a consensus. On most measures, at least a third of the public (and often more) takes a different view. And what goes up can come down.",

It was also too early to say whether the difficulties at Tantangara would add to delays for the whole venture, which was pushed back 12 months to the end of 2027 late last year.Snowy is working through the issues “closely” so that the borer, known as ‘Florence’, is no longer bogged, Whitby said.“Until we get the machine ready for ‘unpausing’ we couldn’t say whether it will delay the whole project,” Barnes said.Launched by the Turnbull government, the Snowy 2.0 project is intended to add 2,000 megawatts of storage to the national electricity market.

And then suddenly, there it was, sitting in the kitchen: a bright orange pumpkin, about the size of my head and equally as weirdly shaped. While I was thrilled to see it, I can take none of the credit for its production. The farmer was my wife, Pat, who fretted appropriately over the way the pumpkin plant clearly shut down all other production to bring forth this one beauty. A reasonably productive tomato plant kept it company. We also got a couple of chillies from a tiny seedling brought to the house by a lunch guest. Tom and Barbara Good had nothing on us.For a while we fretted over what to do with the pumpkin. We thought about carving it into a lantern for Halloween but in truth we’ve opted out of being mugged by children for sugar. Ours are adults. We’re done. Round our way if you don’t put out a pumpkin, the door knocker stays unmolested. So we thought about roasting and even pickling it.But mostly, we admired it. Two thoughts occurred to me, the first of which is obvious. But because I’m a cynical, dreary, hammer-faced excuse for a human it took me by surprise. Growing food at home is marvellous. It’s engrossing. It turns any outdoor space into something functional rather than just ornamental. And the second thought? It’s a terrible way to produce fruit and veg. Awful. Cataclysmically bad. The effort that went into producing that pumpkin was hilariously huge.Does this mean I think people shouldn’t grow their own? No, quite the reverse. We need to keep reminding ourselves just how difficult it is to keep a mass population fed, and what a brilliant job large-scale agriculture does. And the best way to do that is by trying to mimic it at home. There will, of course, be some people with burgeoning allotments and home veg patches who will be chuntering at this.

It’s that simple. If the government disagrees, it needs to provide evidence and prove it in court.”The field was given the green light in September and has the potential to produce 500m barrels of oil in its lifetime, which when burned would emit as much carbon dioxide as running 56 coal-fired power stations for a year.With Rosebank, Britain appears willing to leave climate plans in tatters Read moreThe project has faced stiff resistance, with hundreds of climate scientists and academics and more than 200 organisations, from the Women’s Institute to Oxfam, joining tens of thousands of people across the UK in opposing it.It also flies in the face of warnings from scientists about the impact of the development on the climate, and repeated statements from the International Energy Agency that no new oil and gas exploration should take place if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.Greenpeace UK’s co-executive director, Areeba Hamid, said: “Rosebank’s development was approved under the false claim that it is entirely compatible with the UK’s legally binding climate commitments.

Two other candidates, Tim Scott and Nikki Haley, accepted the well-established scientific reality of global heating but looked to shift the blame to other major carbon polluters, such as China, and even, in Scott’s case, to Africa, which is responsible for about 3% of the world’s emissions.Benji Backer, founder and executive chairman of ACC, said the question on climate was “historic” and highlighted the desire among young Republicans for their leaders to take the threat of global heating seriously.“That we didn’t get an immediate hand raise speaks to how much work we have left to do; young people will never vote for a candidate that doesn’t believe in climate change,” he said after the debate. “We’re not going away, we are normalizing this as part of the Republican conversation.

        "text": "Technologies to clean up traffic exhaust emissions may not be effective for some types of particle pollution, a study has found.If you stand at the edge of any major road, each cubic centimetre of air that you inhale will typically contain tens of thousands of tiny particles, far smaller than the wavelength of light. The small size of these ultrafine particles (UFPs) makes them impossible to see. They are also missed by conventional techniques that measure air pollution, they are not covered by the UK’s air pollution laws and the new study suggests they are evading systems installed in even the most modern vehicles.The researchers from the University of Birmingham analysed more than 10 years of air pollution measurements from alongside London’s busy Marylebone Road. They found some clear successes for cleanup technologies. There were big reductions in larger particles, including diesel soot, as newer vehicles with exhaust filters began to dominate. But the smaller UFPs showed no sign of improvement between 2014 and 2020.The lack of improvement in UFPs from traffic stems from a mismatch between the way vehicles are tested before they can be sold – the vehicle approval test – and their real world use.For particle pollution, the tests were designed about a decade ago to require manufacturers to fit the best cleanup technology available at the time. UFPs are difficult to measure reliably in a vehicle test laboratory since many of them only form as exhaust cools and mixes with the air. The approval system therefore excluded the smallest particles in the exhaust to get a reliable test.Prof Roy Harrison from the University of Birmingham, who led the new study, said: “The low cleanup efficiency with respect to these small exhaust particles was not a surprise, but we had to wait to get several years of good data to be sure of what was happening. The size of the effect – essentially no reduction in the smallest particles – was a surprise.”We cannot afford to ignore the UFPs. In 2021, the Dutch Health Council and the World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted the growing evidence that UFPs are damaging our health.",

We must continue, we will.”Opening the case, Sally Hobson, prosecuting, said: “They accept that on 22 April 2021, they went to the HSBC building armed with hammers and chisels and they also accept that they used those tools to break the windows – they were responsible for the damage.“The value of the damage caused is in the region of £500,000 and additional security measures caused further expenditure so as to ensure damage was not caused again.“Although the defendants accept they caused the damage, they deny that their actions amount to criminal conduct. Simply put, the damage was caused during a protest and the defendants say that they were lawfully justified in doing what they did.",

It shows that the crises experienced by children, and by the adults coming to terms with those crises, are part of a larger ecosystem of emotional difficulty in the extended family.Ane (Patricia López Arnaiz) is a sculptor living in south-west France. She has money worries and problems in her marriage to Gorka (Martxelo Rubio). They have three children, of whom the most troubled is Cocó (Sofía Otero). Eight-year-old Cocó’s worries and self-questioning emerge when Ane has to take the kids away for a summer break over the border in the Basque Country of Spain, staying with her widowed mother Lourdes (Ane Gaberain), who is now devoted to her beekeeping hobby but whose main occupation was once managing financial accounts for her husband, an artist, like Ane.Cocó’s given name was in fact originally the boy’s name Aitor, but switched to the indeterminate nickname Cocó – though even this now feels wrong and Cocó asks Ane to use the name “Lucía”. And it turns out that Lucía only really feels calm and happy in the company of her grandmother and her bees, of which there are, significantly, many different sorts. But there are troubles ahead when a family christening looms at which Lucía and the other children are expected to wear special formal clothes and Lucía will want to wear a dress. Heartsinkingly, Lucía even asks if she can die and be born again as a girl.Ane does not wish to deny Lucía’s gender identity, although it is never exactly phrased in these terms, but she has concerns, and her husband worries that it is too early to be thinking like this in the first place. But Ane has identity issues of her own: her identity as an artist.",

Wiener sausages and the popular maasdamer cheese, which has risen by 94% to €4.84, are among the items to go up most in price. Regarding the cheese, the scientists calculated hidden costs of 85 cents for climate-harming emissions such as methane and CO2, as well as 76 cents for damage to the soil from intensive farming and animal feed production, 63 cents for the effect of pesticides used, including their impact on the health of farmers, as well as 10 cents for pollution of groundwater through the use of fertiliser.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The chief veterinary officer confirmed the decision, after a new assessment of the risk of avian influenza.As a result, boxes of eggs will be able to once again be labelled “free range”.Eggs cannot be classed as free range if the birds that have laid them have been kept indoors for longer than 16 weeks. After that time, eggs are required to be called barn eggs.An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu was first confirmed in the UK in late October 2021, and accelerated during 2022. Officials have said the disease circulates among wild birds, but it is also deadly for captive birds including hens and turkeys.Outbreaks are devastating for farmers because they sweep through flocks, and prompt a cull of birds that have not succumbed to the illness.While the lifting of the housing order has been widely welcomed, officials are warning bird keepers to keep biosecurity measures in place to prevent future outbreaks.Dr Christine Middlemiss, the UK’s chief veterinary officer, said: “The unprecedented nature of this outbreak has proved it’s more important than ever for bird keepers to remain vigilant for signs of disease and maintain stringent standards of biosecurity.”The decision to allow poultry and other birds outside again, as the risks from bird flu reduce, does not remove all of the pressure facing egg producers.",

In London, at The Ninth in Fitzrovia, three-cornered leek, a milder version of wild garlic, has been whipped into aioli, while at Native in Mayfair it is used alongside asparagus. At Seasonality in Maidenhead you can tuck into muntjac deer tartare, while Edinburgh’s The Palmerston uses sika deer extensively.Also in Edinburgh, chef Paul Wedgwood of Wedgwood the Restaurant has had squirrel on the menu since 2008, most famously in squirrel haggis. “It’s mellow, nutty and a bit gamey, and can be substituted for rabbit,” says Wedgwood, who occasionally uses Japanese knotweed and three-cornered leek.Silo is to hold a series of dinners this summer to highlight the issue. Douglas McMaster, the owner and chef of the Hackney Wick restaurant, cut his chops at several Michelin-starred restaurants: London’s St John, Heston Blumenthal’s the Fat Duck and Noma in Copenhagen.The events will feature guest chefs including celebrity chef and campaigner Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who will be challenged to create a menu using Himalayan balsam, and Skye Gyngell of Spring at Somerset House.

The climate crisis was also a contributing factor, he said, with wet snow driving herds towards areas where there are major roads.The Sámi parliament has expressed concern about the changing conditions in the reindeer industry as a result of global heating, with rising temperatures making winter snow conditions more difficult for moving and feeding reindeer.Reindeer husbandry plays an important function in the Sámi community. Rannerud said the relationship was often on an individual basis, with some reindeer so tame that you could almost “pat them on the back”.",

Before 2013, scientists had never recorded three consecutive years of such high CO2 growth.Atmospheric CO2 is now 50% higher than pre-industrial levels.The 2022 methane rise was the fourth-largest since records began in 1983, following record growth in 2021 and 2022, and now stands at an average of 1,912 parts per billion (ppb). Methane is a potent greenhouse gas less abundant than CO2 but which warms the Earth’s atmosphere much faster, and today is responsible for about 25% of the heat trapped by all greenhouse gases.Methane levels in the atmosphere are now more than two and a half times their pre-industrial level. The oil and gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane, which can also cause medical complications, fires and even engine failure leading helicopters to fall out of the sky.Levels of nitrous oxide, the third-most significant anthropogenic greenhouse gas, are now 24% higher than pre–industrial levels, following a 1.25ppb rise last year.Fossil fuel-powered vehicles (cars, buses, trucks, farm machinery) are a major source of nitrous oxide, which is harmful to human health and water sources. But the primary culprits behind rising nitrous oxide levels in recent decades have been synthetic fertilisers and livestock manure from industrialised agriculture.“The observations collected by Noaa scientists in 2022 show that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at an alarming pace and will persist in the atmosphere for thousands of years,” said Rick Spinrad, the Noaa administrator.",

The LA Times reported that the contamination covered an area of seafloor larger than the city of San Francisco. “And what we’re seeing now is that there is DDT that has ended up all over the place, not just within this tight little circle on a map that we referred to as dumpsite two.”California’s legacy of DDT waste: underwater dump site uncovers a toxic historyRead moreDDT, which was widely used in the US as an agricultural pesticide and sprayed in large quantities at beaches to kill mosquitoes, has been linked to cancer and disease in humans and the mass die-off of animals. In the 1970s, it was banned in the US due to its harmful effects on wildlife and potential risks to humans. Research has shown a link between exposure to the chemical and breast cancer as well as reproductive problems.Southern California was the center of DDT production in the US. The Montrose Chemical Corporation in Torrance produced massive amounts of the chemical between the end of the second world war through 1982. During that time, before Congress banned such activity, up to 2,000 barrels a month of acid sludge waste containing DDT were dumped off the coast. Workers sometimes poked holes in the barrel so they would sink more quickly.",

        "text": "Up to 150 public swimming pools in the UK could be offered an innovative way to cut their energy bills by recycling heat from computer data processing centres after a £200m investment by Octopus Energy into a green tech firm.The tech startup Deep Green has already piloted using energy from processing centres to heat swimming pools, with the concept trialled last year in Exmouth, Devon.The new investment announced on Monday is likely to result in the energy solution expanded to leisure centres across the country over the next two years.Mark Bjornsgaard, the chief executive of Deep Green, said the idea could go well beyond providing energy for swimming pools. “If just 1% of the data centre demand in the UK operated on our servers, we could deploy in every public pool in the country. The backing from Octopus is the first step,” he said.“This is no longer just about pools, however. We have received interest from a wide range of other potential partners who could make use of our free heat, such as district heating networks.”Processing data generates a lot of wasted heat, which Deep Green’s scheme aims to repurpose to provide free heat for energy-intensive organisations such as leisure centres, which have been affected by soaring bills in the cost of living crisis, with many having to close or cut hours.Guardian research last year revealed England had lost almost 400 swimming pools since 2010, with parts of the country with the greatest health needs losing out the most.In Exmouth, the swimming pool was able to slash its heating bill by more than 60%. In return, Deep Green gets free cooling which provides it with a significant competitive edge over traditional data centres.Installed on-site, Deep Green data centres do not require additional grid upgrades or planning permission and can be up and running in a matter of weeks, the company says.The technique works for the data centre and the pool – the heat from the computers warms the water and the transfer of heat into the pool cools the computers.The new investment came via Octopus’s dedicated energy transition fund.",

So our low-lying atoll countries, it’s right there, we’re living with it,” said Mata’afa.“There are already examples in the Pacific of communities, whole communities, that have relocated to different countries,” she said. “They’re really having to address issues of sovereignty through loss of land.”Mata’afa warned that all countries would face escalating damage unless they acted now. “This is a collective issue, no one is free from the impacts of climate change,” she said, in an interview with the Guardian. “So it’s very important for the global family to hold to determinations [to cut greenhouse gas emissions] that have already been made. It seems more immediate for us [in the Pacific] but it’s still impacting all of us.”Fiame Naomi Mata’afa.

It’s in our skies, our water, and our land – with record-shattering heat waves, increasingly severe wildfires and flooding from superstorms and rising seas.We have no time for delays. Tackling this crisis and protecting frontline environmental justice communities will take all of us. And the tax-dodging ultra-wealthy need to stop fueling the problem and start supporting first-class solutions.We warned you about this climate emergency. Now it’s here | Peter KalmusRead moreThat’s why, this July, I introduced the Fueling Alternative Transportation with a Carbon Aviation Tax (Fatcat) Act with Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez.Private air travel is the most energy-intensive form of transportation. For each passenger, private jets pollute as much as 14 times more than commercial flights and 50 times more than trains. Despite their sky-high emissions, private air travel is taxed considerably less than commercial air travel.My legislation changes that. Because the 1% should not get a free ride while destroying our environment.At the moment, billionaires and the ultra-wealthy are getting a bargain, paying less in taxes each year to fly private and contribute more pollution than millions of drivers combined on the roads below. Just one hour of flying private negates the climate benefits of driving an electric car for an entire year. That is unfair and it is unacceptable.For the sake of our environment, it is time to ground these fat cats and make them pay their fair share, so that we can invest in building the energy-efficient and clean public transportation that our economy and communities across the country desperately need. We cannot continue to ask frontline communities – disproportionately low-income, rural, immigrant, Black and brown Americans who are bearing the weight of the climate crisis – to subsidize billionaires jet-setting the globe.Our legislation would increase fuel taxes for private jet travel from the current $0.22 to nearly $2 a gallon – the equivalent of an estimated $200 a metric ton of a private jet’s CO2 emissions – and remove existing fuel tax exemptions for private flight activities that worsen the climate crisis, like oil or gas exploration.",

Based on the rate of growth for wind and solar power in recent years, the world is on track to meet this target.But the global energy watchdog has warned that “stronger policy actions by governments” will be required to surmount the obstacles that threaten to slow the progress of wind and solar power developers. Overcoming challenges, such as rising costs, uncertain supply chains and grid bottlenecks, is considered essential for leaders struggling to hit their goal of limiting global heating to within 1.5C of pre-industrialised levels.Tripling the world’s renewables would halve the global demand for coal power by 2030, according to estimates, which would deliver almost half the reductions in methane – a potent greenhouse gas – needed from the coalmining sector this decade.“This is crucial for 1.5C,” said Dave Jones, the global insights lead for climate thinktank Ember. “The tripling goal would take renewables to the next level, with solar and wind reaching 40% of global electricity generation by 2030. Together, these would unlock deep economy-wide fossil fuel reductions and ensure that oil, coal and gas demand not only peak this decade but see a meaningful fall.”The goal has won the support of 118 countries, which could pave the way for a historic opportunity to cement the ambition in the Cop28 final text. In practice, not every country would be increasing its renewable capacity threefold to hit the global target. Some countries starting from a lower level would need to more than triple their wind and solar power, while for others with a high share of renewables already, it would not be feasible to triple their capacity again.",

An official announcement is possible as soon Wednesday, pending approval by the European Commission’s cabinet.The tariffs were planned as early as 2020. So why are they still an issue three years later?Delay EU tariffs to help sales of electric cars, says UK car industryRead moreWhy are tariffs an issue?It stems from Brexit. The UK and the EU agreed the Trade and Cooperation Agreement on Christmas Eve in 2020, setting out the post-Brexit trading relationship. Both sides used the deal to try to spur the creation of a European electric car battery industry.The deal gave carmakers until 1 January 2024 to source batteries from within the UK or EU, or else face 10% tariffs on exports of electric cars either way across the Channel.Batteries are the most expensive component of electric cars, and battery manufacturing is dominated by South Korea, Japan and – most of all – China. The deadline was meant to push carmakers into building batteries in the UK or Europe. Yet approaching the January deadline, carmakers are still dependent on Asian batteries and materials, meaning most UK-EU car exports would become more expensive. Perversely, petrol and diesel cars would be unaffected.What went wrong?The coronavirus pandemic and rising interest rates have got in the way. A huge wave of battery factories in Europe, including two in the UK, is on its way, but will not be ready in time.The carmakers have been arguing in public that they have no way of meeting the deadline.What is at stake if the deadline is not delayed?Tariffs would be unavoidable if the deadline is not extended.",

The mating behaviour was then recorded on video.The results, obtained from 54 females who experienced the clutches of a male, revealed that 83% of females gripped by a male tried rotating their body.Release calls such as grunts and squeaks were emitted by 48% of clasped females – all of whom also rotated their body.Tonic immobility – stiffening with arms and legs outstretched in a pose reminiscent of playing dead – occurred in 33% of all females clasped by a male, with the team adding it tended to occur alongside rotating and calling.Smaller females, they note, more frequently employed all three tactics together than larger ones.While unusual, tonic immobility – it turned out – had been seen before. “I found a book written in 1758 by Rösel von Rosenhoff describing this behaviour, which was never mentioned again,” Dittrich said.The team says tonic immobility could be a stress response. They found this was more common in smaller and therefore younger females, which could be a result of greater stress arising with less experience of reproduction.The three tactics, they add, allowed at least some females to evade the clutches of the males. “Displaying of mate avoidance behaviour resulted in the escape of 25 females.",

But in 1967, a discovery by the marine biologist Roger Payne, who died last Saturday, changed our understanding – ushering in a new way of looking at the world’s largest mammals.As the young Payne listened on repeat for days to recordings made of humpback sounds captured underwater off the coast of Bermuda, he noticed the calls were organised in repeating patterns. Speaking to Guardian Seascape in 2020, he described it as his “wow” moment, spurring on the discovery – made alongside other researchers – that all whale species “sing” in some rhythmic form, even in the “clicks” of toothed whales, such as sperm whales.00:01:06Sound of a solo whale captured underwater – audioSome whales even use the sonata form, common to human music: a theme, followed by a variation, then a return to the theme. The zoologist Katy Payne – Roger’s collaborator (and former wife) – would go on to prove that whales use what can be described as rhyme, a technique whales seem to use to remember long and complex sections of repeating patterns, topped and tailed with “end phrases”.Katy Payne showed humpback whales in a given area sing different versions of the same song – essentially a “hit” – that changes slightly throughout the course of the season. Indeed, it was the humpback – toothless baleen whales, with fleshy, concertina-like jaws – that quickly stood out as the most prolific cetacean singer, creating songs that are also emotionally affecting to human beings.00:01:06Sound of distant whale captured underwater – audioWhy whales sing is still not comprehensively clear, but Roger Payne soon observed differences between their songs and their other social sounds: for example, between the “almost whispering” tone of mothers communicating to calves, and the long, loud broadcasts of males seeking a mate.Roger Payne, conservationist and popularizer of whale song, dies age 88Read moreIt is primarily males that sing songs, though there are some recordings of females singing, too.

Carcasses of Tennessee warblers, hermit thrush, American woodcocks and other varieties of songbirds were recovered.“Not every bird that hits the window is going to leave behind a body,” said Brendon Samuels, who researches bird window collisions at the University of Western Ontario.He noted that the true extent of affected birds will unravel over a couple of days as people continue to pick up birds around downtown Chicago.“In fact, we often see birds collide with glass and they continue flying some distance away, seriously injured in ways that ultimately they won’t survive past a few hours,” Samuels added.Birds dying in large numbers in a small geographic area tends to occur during peak migration periods in spring and fall. Weather conditions like opposing wind, rain and fog can make it difficult for birds to orientate themselves, in addition to light pollution from cities that can draw them in and trap them among deadly structures.“Anywhere you’ve got glass, you’re going to have birds hitting the windows,” said Bryan Lenz at the American Bird Conservancy.

The latest in a series of eco-friendly measures taken by the French government is the “repair bonus”. Instead of throwing into the bin a pair of ripped trousers, a bag with a broken strap or a moth-eaten polo neck, the state will pay for them to be mended at your local cobbler or retoucheur (sewing workshops). From October and for the next five years, we will be able to claim back between €6-€25 of the costs of mending our clothes and shoes with artisans who have joined the scheme.The hope is to help create a virtuous circle, change habits for the planet’s sake (700,000 tonnes of clothing is thrown away in France every year), sustain local artisans and even create jobs in what we now need to call the “refashion” sector. Three years ago, a similar scheme encouraged my compatriots to fix their old toasters or rickety washing machines, rather than dispose of them out of frustration. Legislators even obliged companies to revise their obsolescence strategy by publishing a “repairability index” for each item produced. Consumers can now buy new home appliances knowing in advance how easy (or difficult) they are to repair.I get it: every little helps in the race to reduce our carbon footprint, and the fashion industry is one of the most polluting. But what fresh hell! To think that we need the government to remind us of the most basic things in life, like repairing what’s broken rather than throwing it away in a childish fit?

Why one country is trying to limit its number of livestockRead moreAbout 650m hectares (1,606m acres) was identified as plausible for seaweed farming, with the largest areas in Indonesia and Australia which both have large ocean regions under their economic control.“Cultivating seaweeds for food, feed and fuel within even a fraction of the 650m hectares of suitable ocean could have profound benefits to land use, emissions reduction, water and fertiliser use,” the authors wrote.Scott Spillias, a researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia who led the study published in Nature Sustainability, said: “People around the world are looking at the ocean as this big ‘untapped’ resource and asking if we should be using more of it.”One of the biggest benefits, the study said, would be the cultivation and use of red Asparagopsis as a cattle feed supplement that has been shown to result in drastically lower methane emissions from cows. One supplement based on the seaweed reportedly went on commercial sale to farmers in Australia last year.The study suggested cuts to methane emissions from using Asparagopsis could save 2.6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year by 2050 – about the same as the current greenhouse gas footprint of India.Spillias said introducing more seaweed into human diets could also deliver benefits.",

But experts now say that was a mistake.“During the re-examination of the fossils, we attempted to find the veins of leaves. However, what we observed was a delicate layer of spongy bone tissue, leading us to rule out the possibility that these fossils were from plants,” said Prof Edwin Cadena, a co-author of the study from the Universidad del Rosario in Bogotá.“Instead, we began to compare them with fossils of vertebrates, and images of hatching turtles immediately came to our minds.”Writing in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica, the team report how they compared the fossils with specimens of living marine turtles, as well as fossils of another species of sphenophyllum.The team say that revealed the oval fossils – which are 5cm and 6cm in length – are actually the hard shells, or carapaces, of marine turtles. What were originally thought to be the veins of leaves are actually bone growth patterns, they note, while there is also evidence of bones within the shell called neurals and costals, as well as highly serrated joints between them.The researchers say the turtles were probably less than a year old, and possibly of the species Desmatochelys padillai. This was a type of protostegid, a group of extinct marine turtles that include some of the largest ever to have lived.However, in a nod to the early misidentification the team have nicknamed them “Turtwig”, after a Pokémon character that is half-turtle and half-plant.",

It also allows the public utility to build and own renewables while phasing out fossil fuels.“It’s a historic win for the climate and for clean jobs,” said Lee Ziesche, organizer with Public Power New York, a coalition that has been fighting to pass the legislation for the past four years. “It’ll create a model of public power for the whole country, and it’s really showing that our energy should be a public good.”The Build Public Renewables Act (BPRA) will ensure that all state-owned properties that ordinarily receive power from the New York power authority (NYPA) are run on renewable energy by 2030. It will also require municipally owned properties – including many hospitals and schools, as well as public housing and public transit – to switch to renewable energy by 2035.NYPA provides low-cost electricity to more than 1,000 customers, ranging from local and state government buildings to electric cooperatives, businesses and non-profits. It also sells a portion of its power on the wholesale market, where utilities can purchase it. The legislation will require NYPA to offer low-to-moderate income customers a lower utility rate for renewable energy.The passage of this first-of-its-kind law comes after years of grassroots campaigning by climate and environmental organizers in New York state.NYPA is the largest state public utility in the country. The vast majority of the electricity generated by NYPA comes from hydropower: over 80%. This new legislation will require the state to phase out the six natural gas-fired plants that NYPA operates across New York City by 2030. (NYPA had previously agreed to shut down the plants by 2035.) NYPA built these “peaker plants” in 2001 to meet energy demands during peak times – such as the hottest days of the year.",

With the electric tuk-tuks, basically you don’t have any noise and you don’t have any emission from tailpipes.”In 2021, the levels of the pollutant PM2.5m in Thailand were four times higher than World Health Organization guidance. Inhalation of PM2.5 can cause respiratory problems and heart issues.

As of 2019, there were almost 20,000 tuk-tuks in Thailand, typically powered by internal combustion engines.The demand for electric tuk-tuks is growing, Kritayakirana says. In 2022, their number increased from 263 to 498, according to the Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand. The government has been encouraging EV uptake since 2015.Fariha Essaji, a UK mother who used to live in Bangkok, used the electric tuk-tuks offered by UMT’s ride-hailing app Muvmi because they were cheaper than taxis and bigger than usual tuk-tuks so could accommodate a pushchair. But she says she appreciated the electric element given it made the vehicle less noisy.Muvmi plans to increase its fleet of electric tuk-tuks from 350 to more than 1,000 in Bangkok, climbing to 5,000 nationally within five years. Vichian Suksoir, deputy executive director of the innovation department at Thailand’s National Innovation Agency (NIA), says many hotels are now purchasing electric tuk-tuks to transport guests.",

Photograph: J Haber/UN BiodiversityLess than a year after governments agreed this decade’s targets to halt the destruction of the natural world, Cooper said that while meeting some climate and biodiversity targets required short-term tradeoffs, they were vital for maintaining a habitable planet now and in the future.“I don’t accept that the public mood as a whole is moving against the environment. The public as a whole, and particularly young people, see this as more and more important,” said Cooper.“We see some backtracking in different parts of the world but a lot of this is political groups trying to find wedge issues to gain a marginal advantage in an upcoming election,” he said. “When the public are allowed to express their views, they come up with good decisions.”He cited the recent citizens’ assembly on biodiversity in Ireland and the vote in Ecuador against continuing with oil and gas exploration in the Amazon rainforest as moments when the public had pushed for stronger environmental protections.“People are actually ahead of the governments. We must not allow ourselves to be persuaded that there is a pushback by the public as a whole,” he said.Cooper said he accepted there were sometimes costs in the short term to environmental policies, but said governments should work with communities who felt threatened to find a way forward.",

Instead the government whipped its MPs to reject the draft of the bill containing legal safeguards to stop any environmental laws being downgraded.As the bill returns on Tuesday to the Lords, peers are tabling two more amendments to put an environmental baseline into the bill and prevent protections being downgraded.Ruth Chambers of Greener UK, a coalition of 10 major environmental organisations including the National Trust, RSPB and The Wildlife Trusts, said: “The more that the government refuses to compromise on this amendment, the more suspicious its motives appear. Why would a government that says it is committed to environmental protections continue to resist adding a protective layer in this bill?“It is an uncontroversial change that would provide reassurance to people worried about air pollution and water quality.

Campaigners are particularly concerned about the huge carbon majors it has as clients, including Total, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, ENI, Repsol and Equinor. These companies are involved in more than 200 new fossil fuel projects scheduled for approval by 2025, which would collectively produce about 8.6bn tonnes of carbon dioxide.The bank began planning an exit from coal in 2019 and now says its remaining thermal coal exposure is “only residual”. In 2021, it joined the UN’s Net Zero Banking Alliance.But it has been slower to act on oil and gas.

Traditional Italian salsa verde is made with parsley, capers, anchovy, garlic, vinegar and olive oil, but there are many variations on the theme, including Argentinian chimichurri, British-style mint sauce and salmoriglio, a southern Italian version made with oregano that is especially good with lamb.Coriander, too, makes all sorts of incredible sauces, among them spicy Arabian zhoug and the insanely tasty Canarian mojo verde, which I learned from Sam and Sam Clark and Marianna Leivaditaki of Moro and Morito in London when I helped set up the inaugural banquets at Wilderness Festival. It also features in their book Moro East, where it’s served with papas arrugadas (or “wrinkly” potatoes), a dish of potatoes cooked in water so salty that, when it evaporates, they end up encrusted in salt. The sweetness of the bell peppers and the acidity of the vinegar in the lip-smacking sauce combine with the salty spuds to create an addictive flavour bomb.Coriander stalks are edible, but often get wasted, especially when a recipe calls only for the leaves or a small sprig to finish a dish. To use them as well as the leaves, just finely chop them, too.Mojo verdeThis piquant salsa transforms an abundance of stalky coriander into a sauce of dreams. Once made, the sauce will keep in the fridge for up to a week and can be used on just about anything, though it works especially well with grilled food and on Canarian papas arrugadas.

But both the City of Ballarat and the earth resources regulator said the proposed facility did not meet the threshold to require an environmental effects statement (EES). It has instead been assessed against the requirements of the Mineral Resources Act.The earth resources regulator’s executive director, Anthony Hurst, said dust from the site was continuously monitored by the mine operator and his organisation received regular reports.Balmaine Gold’s mine went into administration in March 2023, shortly after it temporarily ceased production because the existing tailings dam was at capacity.Ballarat resident and secretary of the action group Dr Dora Pearce said the new tailings dam may be needed to shore up the mine, but that didn’t lessen the need for an EES.",

France, for instance, installs 10 times as many heat pumps as the UK, where many people are unfamiliar with them and doubts about their efficacy have been widely publicised. Reports have spread that they do not work well in low temperatures despite their increasing use in Scandinavia and other cold climates.The research, published in the specialist energy research journal Joule, used data from seven field studies in North America, Asia and Europe. It found that at temperatures below zero, heat pumps were between two and three times more efficient than oil and gas heating systems.The authors said the findings showed that heat pumps were suitable for almost all homes in Europe, including the UK, and should provide policymakers with the impetus to bring in new measures to roll them out as rapidly as possible.Dr Jan Rosenow, the director of European programmes at the Regulatory Assistance Project and co-author of the report, said: “There has been a campaign spreading false information about heat pumps [including casting doubt on whether they work in cold weather]. People [in the UK] don’t know much about heat pumps, so it’s very easy to scare them by giving them wrong information.”The Guardian and the investigative journalism organisation DeSmog recently revealed that lobbyists associated with the gas boiler sector had attempted to delay a key government measure to increase the uptake of heat pumps.",

Several African birds of prey are on track to become locally extinct in many countries this century.Published in the journal, Nature Ecology and Evolution, the new research used road surveys to find that nearly 90% of the 42 raptor species studied had experienced declines, with more than two-thirds showing evidence of being globally threatened.Dr Phil Shaw, the study’s author at the University of St Andrews, said the disappearance of apex raptor species could have unintended consequences for humans, citing the example of the decline in Indian vultures that led to a rise in rabies cases in humans in the early 1990s.The study found that the African birds of prey, many of which are big enough to hunt jackals and antelopes as well as snakes, rodents and smaller birds, were becoming increasingly dependent on protected areas such as national parks and reserves. While many populations of raptors also declined in protected areas, the fall was often significantly slower. The researchers cited the importance of a UN target to protect 30% of the Earth by the end of this decade for nature.View image in fullscreenAfrican vultures in South Africa. The new research shows that many birds of prey are declining, even in protected areas. Photograph: The Peregrine Fund“We find that [while] protected areas do provide a good measure of protection, it’s still the case that raptors are declining within protected areas – quite steeply in some cases,” Shaw said. “In fact, we found 40% of those 42 species were declining inside of protected areas at rates that would classify them as being endangered. In effect, they have nowhere else to run.”Shaw said a 2015 study of African vultures, which found many were critically endangered due to poisoning and persecution, was the inspiration for the wider research.What happens when humans meddle with nature?Read more“We’ve looked at 42 species of raptors that also include the vulture species.",

There are five subspecies and all have suffered major drops in numbers caused by climate change, hunting by humans and habitat destruction. As a result, surviving populations of East African, South African and Northeast African cheetahs are now vulnerable, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The other two – the Northwest African cheetah and the Asiatic cheetah – are critically endangered.India’s own population of cheetahs – made up of the Asiatic subspecies – was wiped out last century, with the last documented native animals being shot by Maharajah Ramanuj Singh Deo in 1947. The Asian cheetah now survives only in Iran.By contrast, there are about 6,500 African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), and there have been successes in restoring numbers in semi-managed wildlife reserves in South Africa. With the eradication of its own cheetahs, India launched efforts to re-establish a population using the Southern African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus).

The authors warn that urgent research is needed to assess threats to these mammals.Race to the bottom: the disastrous, blindfolded rush to mine the deep seaRead moreThe research, published in Frontiers in Marine Science, finds that noise pollution in particular could cause damage to the sensitive, intelligent animals.Scientists said the disturbance would be constant for the marine mammals, similar to noisy construction work in a human neighbourhood that was impossible to escape from.“Imagine if your neighbourhood was suddenly disrupted by construction work that goes on 24/7, your life would change dramatically. Your mental health would be compromised, you might change your behaviour to escape from it. It’s no different for whales or dolphins,” said Dr Kirsten Thompson, of the University of Exeter. The research concludes that the constant disturbance could cause ill health.Until now, assessments of impacts from mining have focused on seabed species, as this is the direct area mined. However, scientists say the impact on cetaceans and other large animals that may face harm from sound pollution needs to be urgently assessed before permission for commercial mining is given.Dolphins and sperm whales are among the 25 cetacean species found in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) between Mexico and Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean, according to the paper. However, mining companies are interested in extracting metals and minerals from the seafloor in this area, which is believed to be rich in valuable materials.

I have also started two nurseries for propagating lavender saplings. The village has become a lavender producing and distillation hub,” says Bhushan, who has also installed machinery to extract oil from lavender flowers.“The best part about growing lavender is that many women in villages who are not allowed to work away from home have been encouraged to cultivate lavender around their homes because it is profitable, and this has made them self-reliant,” he says.Women who are not allowed to work away from their villages can cultivate lavender around their homeBharat Bhushan, farmer“The domestic demand for lavender oil is high, and we sell distilled oil directly to industrial customers in cities in India, like Mumbai and Delhi.",

The reasons for forgoing all that new business are entirely economic. The company cited “historic increases in construction costs outpacing inflation, rapidly growing catastrophe exposure, and a challenging reinsurance market”. Those things are owed largely to the wildfires engulfing bigger parts of the state in bigger chunks of the year.California’s woes have a lot to do with the climate crisis, which fuels the hot, dry conditions that turn wooded hills into kindling. It’s also a political failure. Housing crises in the Golden state have pushed more and more people out of densely populated areas and into the so-called wildland-urban interface – places that are cheaper to live in, and more prone to burn. Wealthy homeowners in fire-prone enclaves are also reluctant to move, keen to keep rebuilding properties that keep getting destroyed.Similar dynamics are playing out around the country. Insurance companies are hiking up costs or wholly withdrawing from some areas after deadly, costly flooding in Appalachia and hurricanes in Louisiana and Florida, where property insurance rates are now roughly triple the national average. In each case the rich will make out all right, for now, able to pony up the cost of more expensive policies or relocation. The rest will find themselves on the losing end of what happens when the private sector is entrusted with planning for climate chaos.State Farm didn’t mention climate change in its announcement, of course. The sector has been under pressure from rightwingers that have attacked private sector initiatives like the Net Zero Insurers Alliance (NZIA) as a plot by shadowy globalists to enforce a radical climate agenda through undemocratic means; more concretely, Republican lawmakers are engaged in sabre-rattling premised on the notion that such alliances constitute a violation of antitrust rules.Owing to such pressures, 11 global insurers have left the NZIA since March.",

About 41 million of those are children, older people and people with disabilities, the report found. Three-quarters of those most at risk live in south-east Asia and the Pacific region.Researchers from Resource Futures, an environmental consultancy, and Tearfund, an international Christian charity, found that communities in Cameroon, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ghana, Bangladesh and Indonesia had experienced more severe flooding due to plastic waste blocking drainage systems in the last few years. In these communities, plastic waste was a “risk multiplier” for flooding, they said.A tide of plastic waste clogs waterways in Sylhet, Bangladesh, after floods last July. Photograph: Future Publishing/Getty ImagesTo identify those most at risk, they used a study of flood risk and poverty published in 2022 by Jun Rentschler and others that identified 1.8 billion people at high risk of flooding in 188 nations. They narrowed their analysis to only low and middle-income countries with inadequate urban drainage, solid waste management and sanitation. To focus on the populations most at risk from plastic exacerbating the flood risk, they also excluded countries with mismanaged waste of less than 1kg for each person a year, and focused on urban slums.Rich Gower, a senior economist and policy associate at Tearfund, said: “Around the world, from Brazil to the DRC, from Malawi to Bangladesh, we see plastic pollution making floods worse. Without decisive action, this problem is only going to get worse.”Plastic waste pollution has doubled in the last decade, and is predicted to triple by 2060. Only 9% is recycled globally.Gower said: “The aim of the report is to give an order of magnitude to the number of people at risk.",

They should then use this as a guide to ensure they are collecting or buying the most suitable wildflowers for their gardens.An orange tip butterfly – one of the myriad species attracted by a lady’s smock. Photograph: Albaimages/AlamySwedish researchers who study pollination and biodiversity at Lund University reiterated the importance of going local as the wildflower season blooms across Europe. “Don’t collect seeds further away than you can cycle is usually a good rule of thumb,” said ecologist Maj Rundlöf. Nearly one in 10 wild bee species faces extinction in Europe, data suggests, and the public is increasingly keen to help them. She believes there should be more information available about what to put where.Rundlöf said: “It’s like our food, without knowing where something comes from, we wouldn’t know how to make the right choice. It’s the same with these seeds – labelling is important because it provides people with the information that enables them to choose.”Seed suppliers in Sweden are wrongly marketing their ready-mixed seeds as meadow flowers when the packets contain ornamental plants and grassy weeds from abroad that should not be in a traditional meadow, said Rundlöf and her colleague, Lina Herbertsson. The Swedish Botanical Society is calling for packets of wildflower seeds to carry labels showing their origin to prevent people accidentally spreading non-native species in the wild.In the UK, sourcing seeds from local donor sites – provided it is in line with official guidance – will help rejuvenate the country’s regional wildflower meadows, which are all different and have adapted to local soils and pollinator populations.

Scientists say that the heatwave raised sea surface temperatures, which could have encouraged the formation of a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone, or “medicane”.“While no formal attribution of the role of climate change in making Storm Daniel more intense has been conducted yet, it is safe to say that the Mediterranean sea surface temperatures have been considerably above average throughout summer,” said Dr Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at Leipzig University.“This is certainly true for the region where Daniel could form and wreak havoc over Greece and now Libya … The warmer water does not only fuel those storms in terms of rainfall intensity, it also makes them more ferocious.”But the storm itself was not wholly to blame for the destruction wreaked on Derna, where infrastructure, including the burst dams, was already in a parlous state, according to experts.

More than 18,000 people remain under evacuation order outside Halifax, the region’s largest city. More than 200 structures, the majority of which are homes, have been destroyed by the fire. No fatalities have been recorded.‘Like Nagasaki’: devastating wildfires will only get worse, new book warnsRead moreHot, dry and windy conditions have seen the fire near the community of Tantallon grow to 837 hectares. Temperatures are expected to hit more than 30C this week, giving little respite to fatigued crews.“Today could possibility be a very difficult day,” David Steeves of the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources told reporters. “Today could be a day that is very dangerous for the folks on the ground.”Dave Meldrum, deputy chief of Halifax regional fire and emergency, said exhausted crews have been using “water, raw muscle power and air power” to fight the blazes since Sunday, using three helicopters and fire fighters from the city, province and department of national defence. Even after four days, the fires remains out of control.For a province that typically measures the total amount of the region burned in hundreds of hectares, the record-breaking Barrington Lake blaze, stretching more than 20,000 hectares and still growing, has pushed Nova Scotia’s scarce resources to the brink. The largest ever fire recorded in Nova Scotia was in 1976 and measured 13,000 hectares.“We’ve got more fires than we have resources to support them,” Scott Tingley, manager of forest protection at Nova Scotia’s department of natural resources, said during a news conference, adding the province is prioritizing safety and human life ahead of infrastructure.Firefighters with Halifax regional fire and emergency work to put out fires in the Tantallon area of Nova Scotia.

He is the older brother of Naftali Bennett, the former entrepreneur who became a far-right politician and served as the prime minister of Israel for a year until last June.The trucks built this year in Tilbury will go to customers including the Royal Mail and the builders’ supplier Travis Perkins, with the aim of selling 1,000 vehicles in 2023. It has had test vehicles on the road with the delivery company UPS since late 2019.Decarbonising lorries will be a crucial part of the world’s efforts to reach net zero carbon emissions. About 19% of the UK’s carbon emissions from transport in 2020 were from heavy goods vehicles, according to the Department for Transport.However, truck manufacturers are lagging behind carmakers in preparing for the transition away from fossil fuels because batteries have been too heavy and expensive to use at the scale needed in a lorry travelling long distances.Tevva is not the first company to produce electric lorries in the UK: the Dutch lorrymaker DAF Trucks builds its 19-tonne LF Electric at its Leyland subsidiary in Lancashire. However, DAF is not producing hundreds of trucks a year on a production line.The Tevva trucks will have a 140-miles range from a 105kWh battery, which is nearly double the size of those used in a standard electric car.",

It brings into sharp focus the breadth of flame retardant pollution and dangers it poses.The paper’s lead author, Lydia Jahl, said she expected to find widespread contamination, but was “still blown away by the sheer number of studies finding harmful levels of all sorts of flame retardants everywhere”.“It’s heartbreaking that human advancement doesn’t take health impacts into account for ourselves and for wildlife,” she said. “The people who pollute are not the most impacted – it’s fenceline communities, turtles, dolphins, foxes and butterflies.”Several chemical classes are utilized as flame retardants and in an effort to help reduce fire risks are added to thousands of consumer products from furniture to electronics to auto interiors.The paper found high levels of phased-out flame retardants like PCBs and PBDEs, as well as allegedly safe, newer replacements chemicals, such as chlorinated paraffins and organophosphates, across the globe.

A similar decision was taken in July, when plans to pilot hydrogen in Whitby, Cheshire, were scrapped after local opposition.Some residents raised concerns that they were at risk of becoming unwilling “lab rats” for a technology that would never take off in the UK.The government is due to make a decision about whether its net zero climate plans will include replacing household gas with hydrogen by 2026. It will assess evidence from a pilot in Fife in Scotland, and similar schemes in Europe.Many experts, including the government’s infrastructure tsars, believe that most households should switch to electric heating options, such as heat pumps, while hydrogen is used in heavy industry.On Wednesday, the UK government formally backed plans to ban gas and “hydrogen-ready” boilers from new-build homes in England from 2025.Claire Coutinho, the energy security secretary, said: “Hydrogen presents a massive economic opportunity for the UK, unlocking over 12,000 jobs and up to £11bn of investment by 2030.”The government said on Thursday it would back 11 new projects that planned to make “green hydrogen”, which is produced by splitting water molecules with renewable electricity.

This gives the centre-left the option to either continue governing with the Greens and the left-wing Die Linke, or form a “grand coalition” with the second-placed conservatives.Support for the German Greens, who have been in government at national level since December 2021, slid to 11.7%, down 5.6 percentage points compared with state elections in 2019, providing another sobering moment for the environmentalist party after an underwhelming result at Berlin’s repeat state elections in February.With only 475,500 eligible voters, the election in Germany’s smallest state is not considered a bellwether poll. Bovenschulte’s personality ratings played a strong role in the SPD’s strong showing, and national Green party leaders on Monday attributed their poor performance down to “local mistakes”.A month before the vote, Bremen’s Green transport senator, Maike Schaefer, had provoked local ire by scrapping the so-called “bread-roll button” in one of the city’s districts, a short-term free parking option at parking ticket machines designed to give locals just enough time to pop into a high-street bakery.

With air pollution at illegal levels in many locations for the past decade, causing thousands of deaths a year, local authorities nationwide had announced plans to introduce the zones.But the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in fewer vehicles on the road during lockdown, has led pollution levels to fall. The funding available to local authorities is designed to bring air pollution below legal limits, so some local authorities have been hesitant to proceed while pollution levels remain relatively low.Birmingham’s CAZ was originally scheduled for 2020, but has been delayed until next year, and the council is expected to announce the exact date later this autumn. A spokesperson said: “Birmingham remains committed to launching its clean air zone in 2021.”Sheffield and Bristol have also delayed their CAZs. According to Sheffield city council, the city’s air pollution in January-August this year was 33% lower than the same period in 2019.The government is working with cities on the zones through its Joint Air Quality Unit, managed by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Transport.Sheffield council’s cabinet member for transport, Bob Johnson, said: “Following on from the lockdown required to control the spread of the virus, there have been a number of changes to travel behaviour which has led to improvements in air quality. The current situation is dramatically different to the one in which our proposals were originally developed.”He said the economic uncertainty arising from the pandemic meant the proposed CAZ needed to be reviewed. “If we can hold on to clean air by introducing other measures without resorting to charging people, we believe this is the best way forward,” said Johnson.James Lewis, deputy leader of Leeds city council, said: “If the city’s air pollution is expected to stay below legal limits then we will no longer have the support of the government to introduce a charging clean air zone.",

Six months ago, 12 people died on the southern island of Ischia in a landslide triggered by torrential rain. Eleven more were killed last September by flash floods in the central region of Marche.Last July, amid a heatwave and Italy’s worst drought for at least seven decades, an ice avalanche in the Italian Alps killed 11.It is too soon for an attribution study to determine how much worse, or more likely, this week’s floods were made by human-caused global heating.But across Europe, as atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide increase, so too does extreme weather – consecutive years of drought have afflicted farmers in Spain and southern France, while last year there were unprecedented heatwaves across the continent.“Climate change is here and we are living the consequences. It isn’t some remote prospect, it is the new normal,” Paola Pino d’Astore, an expert at the Italian Society of Environmental Geology (SIGEA), told Reuters.Experts say Italy’s geography makes it particularly vulnerable to climate disasters: its varied geology make it prone to floods and landslides, while rapidly warming seas either side make it vulnerable to increasingly powerful storms, amid rising temperatures.The frontlines of the climate crisis have hitherto been in the global south, leading to the oft-repeated refrain that those least responsible for the climate crisis are facing the worst effects. But for Italy now, and probably soon the rest of Europe, the enemy is at the gates.Last August, a weather station near Syracuse on the southern island of Sicily recorded 48.8C, which is thought to be the highest temperature ever measured in Europe. While the world fights a losing battle to keep the increase in global average temperatures below 1.5C, in Italy average temperatures over the past 10 years are already 2.1C higher than in pre-industrial times.",

The other six were “rapidly deteriorating”, the MMSC said on Facebook.An onlooker, Tim Ramsey, told CBS: “Six big dolphins [were] flapping around on the beach and I was kind of stunned for 30 seconds or so.”Half a dozen officers and rescuers spent hours pouring seawater on to the dolphins, to no avail.“The remaining six dolphins were assessed by our veterinarian and their conditions were rapidly deteriorating,” MMSC said.“The decision was made to humanely euthanize the dolphins to prevent further suffering, as returning them to the ocean would have only prolonged their inevitable death.“All eight dolphins have been transported to the NJ state laboratory for immediate necropsies. We share in the public’s sorrow for these beautiful animals, and hope that the necropsies will help us understand the reason for their stranding.”The dolphin deaths come less than a week after two dolphins stranded and died on a different beach in New Jersey.According to MMSC, an adult dolphin was dead by the time rescuers arrived. Rescuers rescued a calf but after it was transported to a clinic, a veterinary exam determined that it was in an “extremely weakened condition and could not survive”. Doctors then made the decision to euthanize.As of last month, at least nine dead whales had washed up on the New Jersey coast this year, deaths described by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) as “unusual mortality events”.",

While we could point to landscape fires, burning oil refineries and the thirst of diesel-hungry military vehicles, the emissions data they sought just wasn’t available. When it came to the reverberating consequences of Russia’s manipulation of Europe’s fossil fuel insecurity, or to the weakening of the international cooperation necessary for coordinated global climate action, our guesses were no better than theirs.Two decades of international analysis and debate over the relationship between climate change and security has focused on how our rapidly destabilising climate could undermine the security of states. But it has largely ignored how national security choices, such as military spending or warfighting, can have an impact on the climate, and so undermine our collective security.With climate breakdown under way and accelerating, it is imperative that we are able to understand and minimise the emissions from all societal activities, whether in peacetime or at war. But when it comes to military or conflict emissions, this remains a distant goal.Russia’s war in Ukraine has seen the first attempt to comprehensively document the emissions from any conflict, and researchers have had to develop their methodologies from scratch. Their latest estimate puts the total as equivalent to the annual emissions of a country like Belgium. Ukraine is not a one-off, with a similar clamour for emissions data around Israel’s war against Hamas. While the devastating ongoing conflicts in Sudan or Myanmar are yet to see attention on their emissions, the trend is clear: the carbon cost of conflict needs to be understood, just as the humanitarian, economic or wider environmental costs do.Russia and Israel lead global surge in attacks on civilian water suppliesRead moreA proportion of those carbon costs come from military activities. For these, understanding is hampered by the longstanding culture of domestic environmental exceptionalism enjoyed by militaries, and how at the US’s insistence, this was translated into UN climate agreements. An exclusion to the 1997 Kyoto protocol became voluntary reporting under the 2015 Paris agreement.",

Here’s my wholegrain version.Vegan wholegrain doughnutsRichard Makin has made it his mission to reinvent and veganise classic recipes, from New England-style lobster rolls to nonna’s lasagne. His recipes are great fun and, importantly, they work, too.It’s miraculous what the liquid from a tin of chickpeas is capable of, and these clever aquafaba doughnuts are a case in point. The aquafaba binds the dough, which puffs up into delicious, pillowy treats. I’ve tweaked Richard’s original recipe to make these doughnuts a whole food, and even made with wholegrain flour they are light and fluffy.They’re best eaten fresh, so fry only as many asyou want to eat at a time. If need be, prove the rolled doughnuts in the fridge overnight or even freeze them (remove from the fridge or freezer and, when fully defrosted and doubled in size, they’ll be ready to fry).Save any leftover oil for cooking other foods or to fry your next batch of doughnuts. Once cool, strain it through a fine sieve and/or a clean cloth, seal in a clean container and store. Use up any leftover cinnamon sugar, too, in a cup of chai or sprinkled over cereal.Richard fills his cooked doughnuts with a scrumptious jam made with doughnut peaches, but experiment with your own fillings – my maple apple butter from last week goes really well with them, too.Makes 10 mini doughnuts150g wholemeal bread flour80g fine plain wholemeal flour, plus extra for dusting2 tbsp unrefined sugar2 tsp easy-bake yeast½ tsp sea salt2 tbsp (30g) extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for deep-frying160g aquafaba (ie, the liquid from 1 tin of chickpeas)50g unrefined sugar – I used rapadura sugar, but any will do1 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)In a stand mixer or bowl, combine the bread flour, plain flour, yeast and salt.",

Children’s lungs can’t wait,” says Jemima Hartshorn, a Brixton resident who helped set up campaign group Mums For Lungs.London’s filthy air makes chronic illnesses worse, shortens life expectancy and damages lung development in children. Levels of nitrogen dioxide, mostly produced by diesel vehicles, have been illegally high since 2010 in the vast majority of urban areas in the UK. Noxious emissions make chronic illnesses worse and shorten life expectancy, typically by six months.A spokesperson for the mayor said: “London’s toxic air increases the risk of asthma and dementia and can damage children’s lung growth. The mayor has delivered a series of hard-hitting measures to tackle our filthy air, from cleaning up the bus fleet to introducing a toxicity charge in central London for the most polluting vehicles. A vital step will be the introduction of the ultra-low emission zone in April next year, which will be the toughest emission standard adopted by any city in the world and will improve air quality for millions of Londoners.”London's ultra-low emission zone: what you need to knowRead moreSimon Alcock, head of public affairs at Client Earth, a firm of environmental lawyers, says the city has “no choice” but to bring in the ULEZ because of the already illegal levels of NOx in the city’s air. “If water was as dirty as our air, we would have taken action much earlier,” he says.Earlier this year, the high court ruled that the government’s current policy on air pollution was unlawful, and ordered changes.But Alcock acknowledges the issues faced by diesel drivers.“Everyone was encouraged to buy diesels by successive governments as they thought it was good for climate change. But it was really bad for your health. I think it’s really important that we help drivers to make the shift, through scrappage schemes or making electric vehicles cheaper to buy.”The case against: ‘The poorest will be hit hardest’The ULEZ charges will be “Sadiq Khan’s poll tax”, warns Gareth Bacon, leader of the Conservatives in the Greater London Assembly.“The introduction of a daily £12.",

At Stoke Fleming, near Blackpool Sands beach in Devon, there were 63 sewage spills lasting 1,014 hours; and at Meadfoot beach in Torquay, Devon, there were 79 dumps lasting 946 hours.The figures come from an analysis of Environment Agency data done by the Liberal Democrats.The environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, will announce government plans to clean up Britain’s waterways on Tuesday, but critics say the headline policy of banning plastic in wet wipes was first announced in 2018.Coffey will also say her team is looking at reducing PFAS substances – known as forever chemicals – in materials. But her Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) admitted it did not yet have a “firm course of action”.The Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron said: “Yet again, the Conservative government is taking the public for fools by re-announcing a wet wipe policy from five years ago. This is a complete farce. The government is all talk and no action when it comes to protecting our rivers and oceans from foul pollution.“The main cause of water pollution is the water firms. Ministers are still letting water companies get away with an environmental scandal and today’s pathetic announcement will do nothing to stop that.”Coffey has been under pressure to show that the government is acting on the sewage dumping scandal as it is becoming an issue in local elections, with rising public anger over the situation.Farron called again for Coffey to resign. The Lib Dems previously said she should leave her post over sewage statistics released last week. He said: “This is further proof why Thérèse Coffey should resign.

The nature restoration law was announced alongside separate legislation proposing a crackdown on chemical pesticides with the aim of reversing the catastrophic loss of wildlife on the continent.But there is growing concern that the laws could be abandoned entirely amid opposition from agricultural, fishing and forestry lobbying groups, and some member states. On Tuesday, the European parliament’s agriculture committee voted to reject the nature restoration legislation, and the fisheries committee followed suit on Wednesday.The nature restoration law is a key part of the European green deal that is crucial to meeting international climate and biodiversity commitments. On Monday , the commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said there would not be another proposal.The law aims to reverse the decline of pollinating insects while restoring forests, marine areas and other ecosystems key to food production to improve Europe’s resilience to climatic shocks as the planet warms. It was a key part of the EU’s negotiating position at Cop15 in Montreal last year, where the world agreed to protect 30% of the planet for nature.The centre-right European People’s party (EPP) has called for the nature restoration and pesticide proposals to be scrapped entirely, with liberal MEPs also divided on the issue. MEPs from both groups voted against the nature proposals this week, provoking anger from NGOs.Sabien Leemans, a senior biodiversity policy officer at WWF Europe, said: “With this rejection, the majority of MEPs in the agri committee are failing all citizens, including farmers. At times when Italy is devastated by flooding and Spain is experiencing severe droughts, this denial of what is happening in Europe is unacceptable.“The science is clear that nature restoration will increase our resilience to such extreme weather events and support long-term food security. Meanwhile, the agri committee is rejecting the legal proposal to restore nature.

A closeup image shows the fungus wrapped around the body of a trapdoor spider, poking out of the burrow from which the arachnid grabs insects.Researchers said there was no evidence that the new parasitic fungus controlled the behaviour of trapdoor spiders before killing them, like their zombie-ant fungi relatives, which overcome the insects and trick them into leaving their nests to go to places where they can spread their spores and have been made famous by the post-apocalyptic TV drama The Last of Us.‘A really beautiful thing’: the purple fungus infects and kills the spiders. Photograph: João AraújoThe fungus was found in November during a field trip to forests north of Rio de Janeiro to document the area’s biodiversity and search for new species. It will need a formal scientific description before it is confirmed as a new species.“It’s a really beautiful thing,” said Dr João Araújo, a Brazilian mycologist with the New York Botanical Garden, who made the discovery but has not yet decided on a name. “They infect trapdoor spiders, and it’s one of the very few cordyceps that are purple, which is a cool feature.“We don’t know much about this fungal group because it’s very understudied. This kind of fungus has been collected very few times in the world, mostly in Thailand. This will likely be the first time we sequence a species like this from Brazil.”The Atlantic rainforest is one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world.

I’m hopeful more progress can be made.”A report from Debt Service Watch, a coalition of debt campaign groups, said the outlook for developing countries was worse than during the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s and during the two rounds of multilateral debt relief in the late 90s and mid-2000s.Debt service was absorbing 54% of budget revenue and 40% of public spending in Africa, the report said.

After two weeks of lockdown, there was a dramatic increase in bird-related searches.These increases were seen in data from 115 countries spanning six continents. The lead author, Darryl Jones, professor of ecology at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, said the study was the first to investigate interest in bird feeding on a global scale.“If bird feeding is common in other parts of the world, this could impact migration and disease patterns,” Jones said. “It is imperative that we understand the global extent of bird feeding in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its potential impacts.”Bird feeding, he said, had implications for human as well as bird wellbeing. For people, wild bird feeding is one of the most effective ways to connect with nature– and connection with nature has consistently been shown to benefit human health.Spending as little as 10 minutes in nature can significantly enhance wellbeing, and exposure to nature has been linked to improved attention, lower stress and reduced risk of anxiety and depression.Bird feeding can be beneficial for the birds, too: it can increase birds’ antioxidant levels, reduce their stress, and contribute to faster feather growth. Human feeding can provide a source of food for birds in times of scarcity that they otherwise may not have survived.However, there are also concerns that feeding wild birds could affect their development. The kākā, a large species of parrot which was successfully reintroduced to Wellington, New Zealand, could develop bone disease as a result of being overfed with foods containing the wrong nutrients, the researchers warned.Because of its potential impact on migration, bird feeding could also lead to a reshaping of the ecological communities of birds, which could affect biodiversity.The authors also examined the link between interest in bird feeding and biodiversity.",

If you’re a climavore who wants to eat for the planet, but avocados are still a must, eat them less often, as a special treat, and use European-grown and organic ones whenever possible.Most importantly, though, don’t waste them. Avocados labelled as “ready to eat” cost more and are often overripe. That said, it can be tricky to ripen them yourself at home, but if you ever find yourself landed with an inedible, rock-hard avocado, it can still be saved – try ripening it alongside a banana, say –the ethene released by the banana will help ripen any fruit by converting its starches to sugars – or turn it into avocado fries, which are an unexpectedly delicious surprise that can convert an underripe avocado into a fun weekend dish or party piece.Avocado friesThis recipe was a revelation to me. Sometimes, avocados just don’t ripen and end up going off before they are ready to eat. The last time this happened to me, rather than dispose of the fruit, I chopped it up and added it to a Mexican stew. That led to further research and the discovery of today’s dish. If you are cooking more than one avocado, you won’t need to multiply the other ingredients by the same amount: just add by eye some extra flour, aquafaba (or egg), and breadcrumbs (if you don’t have any stale bread or breadcrumbs, polenta makes a great alternative) – the aim is simply to coat the avocado pieces evenly.You can season the avocado with lime juice and sea salt and pepper to help maintain its colour and heighten the flavour, but it’s not essential, because the fries can be seasoned afterwards. They are also delicious dressed with a squeeze of lime just before eating.Firm or under-ripe avocados work best here, but even ripe ones will work, provided they are firm enough to hold their shape.",

They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because most do not degrade in the environment.Peer identified over 10,300 PFAS waste shipments between June 2018 and June 2023. The most common disposal methods were incineration, landfilling, discharge into wastewater treatment systems, and deep well injection.Facilities disposing of the largest amounts of PFAS waste included a US Ecology plant in Nevada, a deep-well injection site near Houston, and an incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio, just upwind from East Palestine, the site of a toxic Norfolk Southern train derailment in February.But there are problems with each method. Deep well injection involves sending the chemicals into the Earth’s crust, and that process, as well as landfilling, have been found to leak PFAS into nearby drinking water supplies. Incineration may only partially destroy PFAS, and can widely disperses them through the atmosphere. When the chemicals land, they can contaminate water, soil and crops.“There is no known way to safely dispose of PFAS and that’s the problem,” Whitehouse said.",

These nutrients, when untreated, cause algal blooms that choke the life from rivers.Under the current system, which is derived from EU law, developers are not allowed to add more pollution to already-polluted protected areas, unless they buy “credits” that are used to improve nearby wetlands.In a letter to the secretaries of state Thérèse Coffey and Michael Gove, the chair of the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP), Dame Glenys Stacey, said their proposed amendment, which they claim will unlock 100,000 new homes, would degrade the environment.She wrote: “The proposed changes would demonstrably reduce the level of environmental protection provided for in existing environmental law.

It has written to the environment secretary and her predecessors on numerous occasions to express concern that her department’s plans will contravene environmental law.However, Coffey has been able to ignore it and proceed with her plans regardless.Stacey has demanded the ministers face parliament to explain themselves and tell colleagues how they plan to prevent rivers being choked by pollution.The solicitor and civil servant said the ministers were contravening their promises to parliament, referring to “Gove’s statement to parliament, under section 20 of the Environment Act 2021, that ‘the bill will not have the effect of reducing the level of environmental protection provided for by any existing environmental law’”.

Every new-build would have had to comply with the rule.Germany plans to ban installation of most oil and gas heating from 2024 Read moreUnder the new proposals the onus is shifting from individual households to municipal authorities, which will be expected to scale up their goals for district heating planning, which often draws on geothermal energy, and to assess the needs of every household, including their suitability for connection to such a system.Pressure was on the coalition to reach agreement in time for the energy law to be put to the parliament, or Bundestag, before 7 July, its last sitting before the summer recess. The draft law will start its passage through parliament this week.Instead of stiff rules, Habeck said, the coalition now had a set of “guidelines” that would help households transition to renewable energy. “In this way we’re giving people more time … I think this is the right thing to do and is completely in keeping with my interest,” he said in Berlin.The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats (SPD), said the coalition had experienced “judders” over the intense, often angry debate that had accompanied the creation of the draft, but that “this has now juddered to a conclusion”.",

Excessive heat causes more deaths in the US than other weather-related disasters, including hurricanes, floods and tornadoes combined.Scientists also say more frequent and intense heatwaves are likely in the future because of the climate crisis and a deepening drought in the American west.The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported a temperature of 114F (46C), tying the record high for the date set back in 1918.Las Vegas tied a record for the day set in 1956, with temperatures soaring to 109F (43C). The National Weather Service said there was a chance the high temperatures in both cities could rise even more.In Colorado, Denver hit 100F (38C), tying a record set in 2013 for both the high temperature and the earliest calendar day to reach 100F.Temperatures in several inland areas of California reached triple digits by the afternoon, with a record high for 11 June of 122F (50C) reached in Death Valley.Excessive heat warnings and heat advisories were issued for parts of Northern California through the Central Valley and down to the south-eastern deserts.The National Weather Service also predicted 114F (46C) in Palm Springs and temperatures around 100F (38C) across the San Joaquin Valley and the Sacramento area.Heat was expected to extend to inland portions of the San Francisco Bay Area but most of the California coastal zones remained free of heat advisories.The scorching heat in northern California was expected to subside on Saturday evening. Heat advisories in parts of southern California were extended through Sunday.Meteorologists warned of very high “heat risk” in south-central Arizona through the weekend.

Liverworts, mosses, lichens, ferns, tiny herbaceous plants and crevice-rooted trees.Legend grows thicker still. The story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (written down in the 14th century but doubtless older) tells of a year-long duel between a Knight of the Round Table and a mysterious green giant. In the first round, at a Yule feast in Arthur’s court, Gawain strikes his opponent’s head clean from his shoulders, only for the giant to collect it, and goad the young hero to travel to a mysterious Green Chapel a year hence and receive a single blow in return.

The dialect used by the anonymous medieval storyteller is certainly local.

The density had dropped even further in areas outside the impact zone, by more than half.Race to the bottom: the disastrous, blindfolded rush to mine the deep seaRead moreTravis Washburn, an ecologist who works with the Geological Survey of Japan and was the lead author of the study, published in Current Biology, said the findings had “large implications” for decision-makers negotiating regulations on proposals for deep-sea mining.“We may need to broaden what we think of in terms of what deep-sea mining impacts are,” said Washburn, whose work focuses on the benthic zone – the lowest region of a body of water. “There are large implications if we are currently treating some sites as unimpacted or controls when they are in fact changing from indirect mining impacts.”The team of scientists analysed data from visits by Japanese mining engineers to the Takuyo-Daigo seamount. A year after the test extraction, researchers observed a 43% drop in fish and shrimp density in the “deposition” areas directly affected by sediment pollution, and a 56% drop in surrounding areas.“It is easy to assume that once you are outside the zone of deposition there will be no impacts from mining,” said Washburn. “However, if some animals leave the periphery of the deposition area, this would extend the total area of impact.",

His research there in 1965-66 anchored a lifetime devoted to understanding, explaining and advocating for poor rural people around the world.Rather than being backward and conservative as some supposed, such communities acted rationally and managed resources efficiently. In his paper The Theory of the Optimising Peasant (1968), Michael explained that poor, small farmers were often reluctant to adopt new varieties of wheat and rice such as those rolled out in the green revolution of the mid-20th century, despite the average yield being higher than that of traditional varieties. This was because when the new varieties failed, because of drought or disease, they did so more spectacularly than traditional varieties, and thus increased the risk of hunger and destitution. When later generations of the green revolution crops reduced the risk, poor farmers adopted them with enthusiasm.Michael also showed that in land-scarce situations, poor farmers managed the land more intensively and more efficiently than richer ones; and he debunked the idea that poor farmers were wasteful, showing that grain losses on farms were often minimal.These ideas helped overturn the idea that national development could only come via industrialisation, at the expense, usually via high taxation, of rural areas. Michael’s big book, Why Poor People Stay Poor: Urban Bias and World Development (1977), set out to map in detail the ways in which urban-focused elites and policymakers discriminated against the rural poor.In other work, Michael crossed the boundaries of disciplines to explore the linkages between agriculture, health and nutrition. In a short book for the World Health Organisation with Emanuel de Kadt, Agriculture-Health Linkages (1988), the authors demonstrated how the health and nutrition of rural people were shaped by agricultural policy: what was grown, at what price, and where. They showed how to make agricultural policymaking and institutions more responsive to the health needs of poor people, especially women, in rural areas.",

The deal comes as diplomats meet in Nairobi, Kenya, to hammer out a global treaty on plastic pollution.“The EU will finally assume responsibility for its plastic waste by banning its export to non-OECD countries,” said Pernille Weiss, a Danish member of the European parliament with the centre-right EPP group, who was in charge of the proposal. “Once again, we follow our vision that waste is a resource when it is properly managed, but should not in any case be causing harm to the environment or human health.”The rules, which must be formally approved by the European Council and parliament before they come into force, set tighter controls on exports of plastic waste to rich countries and stop exports entirely to non-OECD countries. After five years, countries who then wish to import EU plastic waste can request the commission lift the ban for them if they prove they will treat it well.Most plastic thrown away in Europe gets burned, and less than a third gets recycled. Campaigners have raised concerns that some plastic waste shipped abroad for recycling ends up in landfills and waterways.Lauren Weir, a campaigner from the Environmental Investigation Agency, said: “Whilst this is an improvement to current obligations, the evidence of the harms and necessity for a full plastic waste ban are clear. This is a signal that the EU is finally beginning to take responsibility for its role in the global plastic pollution emergency.”The rules mean some forms of non-plastic waste may still be shipped to non-OECD countries if they fulfil certain social and environmental criteria.The law could also lead to an increase in waste shipped to OECD countries such as Turkey.Sedat Gündoğdu, a microplastics researcher at Çukurova University in Turkey, said: “The ban of plastic waste exports to non-OECD countries is a significant decision.",

They spend the majority of their lives in these systems, leaving them unable to exhibit normal behaviours.The RSPCA has accused the government of a “race to the bottom for animal welfare standards” as conventional battery systems were banned in the UK in 2012. The CPTPP trade deal is due to be signed on 16 July, and campaigners are calling for the government to disallow eggs not produced to UK animal welfare standards.David Bowles, the head of public affairs at the RSPCA, said: “If this deal is agreed, it will not only set our own egg producers at a disadvantage, it will also directly impact RSPCA standards on laying hens, which account for over one in two eggs produced in the UK. The government is starting the gun on a race to the bottom for our animal welfare standards.”Egg products could be imported from countries such as Mexico, which relies almost exclusively on battery cages for egg production. Such imports would undercut British egg producers who operate to significantly higher standards of animal welfare under the British Lion code of practice.Dr Nick Palmer, the head of Compassion in World Farming UK, added: “Without adequate tariffs to only allow imported eggs produced to UK standards, the doors will be wide open for powdered and liquid eggs from countries with lower or no animal welfare standards – this is not what UK consumers expect of our government, which promotes high standards of hen welfare, environmental protection and food safety.”There have recently been concerns about the egg supply chain, after bird flu and costs caused farms to go out of business.

Fortunately, researchers kept three small plants in pots on a windowsill in the University of York. These short-lived annual plants soon died, but they produced a precarious pinch of seed, which was lodged at Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank.Andrew Shaw of the Rare British Plants Nursery had a vision to bring the species back to life, but when tests were carried out on some privately held seeds very few germinated successfully.So Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog, quickly authorised a de-extinction attempt via its species recovery programme, which has funded the revival of the most threatened native species for 30 years.“The Millennium Seed Bank said the seed was getting near the end of its lifespan and so we thought we would only have one more chance of resurrecting it,” said Alex Prendergast, a vascular plant senior specialist for Natural England.Natural England paid for a polytunnel at the Rare British Plants Nursery in Wales, where 100 of the tiny seeds were planted. To the botanists’ surprise, 98 of the seeds germinated successfully. The polytunnel rapidly filled with a thousand York groundsel plants.In February six grams of seed – potentially thousands of plants – were sown into special plots around York on council and Network Rail land.This week, the first plants in the wild for 32 years began to flower, bringing colour to the streets and railway sidings of York.",

Another third are new varieties bred to need less cold over winter, and the final third are from warmer countries including South Africa. The varieties will be compared to see which has the best crop in London’s warming temperatures.In January, the Met Office announced that 2022 had been the sixth warmest year on record, and it looks as if 2023 will be another record-breaker. But though many crops are affected by the summer’s intense heat and drought, apple trees are struggling because they need a period of cold over the winter.In autumn, they store enough energy to see them through the dormant period, and then burst into action again in spring. Perfect chilling hours for apples are those below 6C but above freezing, and most traditional apple trees need about 1,000 chilling hours. If temperatures remain above 6C then they have to respire, using up energy stores throughout the winter period, which in turn limits the stores available in spring, meaning fewer apples grow.Gala apples are a popular variety grown in New Zealand, but the horticulturalist Helena Dove, who runs Kew’s kitchen garden, said the breed may overtake traditional varieties in Britain.“The Gala was bred in New Zealand, which means it only needs about 600 chilling hours, which is more like what we’re getting at the minute in the UK,” she explained.“We will see if gala has a better crop than nonpareil, which was bred in 1696. We are also trying the Fuji apple, which originated in Japan and only needs 400 chill hours, which might do better in these milder winters.",

The New Man, from 2016, was about impending fatherhood; Husband, from 2022, showed his complicated feelings about Baum’s career outpacing his. The second was a goofy performance in the autofictional-autofactual grey area; Appignanesi’s cheerfully dishevelled figure was at the centre of almost every shot, sometimes leaving us to wonder if and where he had staged or reconstructed certain important moments – a heightened video-diarising or guided reality.Now, he has taken what appears to be a quantum leap to a new level of seriousness. A professional setback just before lockdown (the sudden disappearance of funding for a projected feature) leaves him with time on his hands and Appignanesi takes an interest in Extinction Rebellion. He brings his camera to marches and meetings and is soon a deeply committed member, culminating in a triumphant speech at an XR protest outside 55 Tufton Street in central London, the notorious headquarters of climate-denying thinktanks, storming it in front of the crowd.

On one march, he finds himself alongside the comedy writer David Schneider; their banter seems to relax him and the film’s punning title demonstrates his comedy instinct.The question arises whether he has cultivated a kind of Louis Theroux ambiguity in talking to the long-term XR faithful to suppress a mickey-taking impulse, or to create the space for his audience to do the mickey-taking on his behalf. Actually, no; he later tells his wife that people’s testimonies at a certain XR meeting really had brought him close to tears.",

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In the letter last week to Azoulay, seen by Guardian Australia, Plibersek asked for confirmation Australia had done enough to satisfy Unesco’s concerns, which included a recommendation last year from a monitoring mission that the reef should be placed on the “in-danger” list.Azoulay said there had been a year of dialogue between Australia and Unesco, with the country making commitments against 10 “high priority recommendations” delivered by the UN-backed monitoring mission.“The Great Barrier Reef is fragile jewel of world heritage,” Azoulay said. “For many years, Unesco has not ceased alerting the world to the risk of this site losing its universal value forever.Australia’s ‘first carbon-neutral telco’: do Telstra’s environmental claims about Belong stack up? | Temperature CheckRead more“We have proposed several concrete measures which provide a roadmap for tackling the problem. I am delighted that the dialogue between our experts and the Australian authorities has now resulted in a set of formal commitments.”In the letter, Plibersek outlined the government’s commitments on improving water quality, fisheries reforms and “strong, legislated climate action” that aimed to address the concerns of Unesco’s experts.This week the Albanese government announced a $160m plan to phase out commercial gillnet fishing on the reef and to accelerate fisheries reforms in Queensland – one of the areas of concern.The world’s biggest reef system will be reviewed again by the world heritage committee at its next meeting in September, hosted by Saudi Arabia.Before that meeting Unesco is due to publish a “state of conservation” report on the reef that will recommend whether it should be placed on the in-danger list – a test of whether the Albanese government has done enough to satisfy Unesco.",

It was captured by the English during an attack on the Dutch Smyrna convoy in 1672 but was too damaged to avoid sinking.The wreck has many stories to tell but any thefts or amateur investigation could cause irreparable damage, said Meara.“It’s not just the artefact you lose, it is all that potential for knowledge and learning and education.",

The people most likely had food stores that would get them through a single year of drought. But when hit with three consecutive years, there was no food to sustain them,” Brita Lorentzen, a University of Georgia anthropology professor and study co-author, said.“This would have led to a collapse of the tax base, mass desertion of the large Hittite military and likely a mass movement of people seeking survival. The Hittites were also challenged by not having a port or other easy avenues to move food into the area,” Lorentzen added.Indo-European languages originated from HittitesRead moreThe Hittites, with their capital Hattusa situated in central Anatolia, were one of the ancient world’s great powers across five centuries. They became the main geopolitical rivals of ancient Egypt during its glittering New Kingdom period.“In pre-modern times, with none of our infrastructure and technology, the Hittites controlled and ruled a huge region for centuries despite myriad challenges of space, threats from neighbors and entities incorporated into their empire, and despite being centered in a semi-arid region,” said Cornell University professor of arts and sciences in classics Sturt Manning, lead author of the research published in the journal Nature.Scholars long have pondered what triggered the fall of the Hittites and broader collapse that also devastated kingdoms in Greece, Crete and the Middle East while weakening the Egyptians. Hypotheses have included war, invasion and climate change. The new study offers some clarity about the Hittites.",

The scheduled action was due to also include staff in Terminal 3, where carriers such as Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines and Emirates operate.Unite said the first strikes were called off as “a gesture of goodwill” after talks, but the rest were still scheduled to go ahead if the pay offer was rejected.The union’s regional coordinating officer, Wayne King, said: “Following extensive negotiations last week a new offer was put forward by Hal [Heathrow Airport Limited]. Members will now be balloted on the latest offer and they will decide whether or not it meets their expectations.”A Heathrow spokesperson said: “We are pleased to have agreed a pay deal, which unions are recommending their members to accept. This is a great deal for colleagues, giving them two years of guaranteed above-inflation pay rises, alongside further benefits and assurances that they told us they wanted. We encourage them to accept the deal so that everyone can have certainty and the backdated pay increase that so many have been waiting for.”Earlier on Monday, Heathrow reported it had managed the previous strikes in May, when it carried 6.7 million passengers with no delays at security, and had built up a contingency team to cope with the summer action.",

But some farmers have raised concerns about how the reintroductions could affect their work.The environment secretary told the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) conference in Birmingham that “farmers do not need to worry” about species reintroductions and said she would rather focus on species and habitats already in the UK.Coffey said: “I don’t want farmers to constantly have to worry about these issues. We’ve got plenty to do with the habitats that need improving and expanding.”She added that when there were proposals to release sea eagles in her constituency, “farmers were really worried about what this would do to their livestock, particularly given the extent of free range farming in that part of the country”. There has been little to no evidence of sea eagles taking livestock, but they do feed on carrion.Coffey summed up: “I won’t be supporting reintroductions of species like lynx and wolves.”Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, which has been involved in beaver release trials and is working on a policy around releasing wildcats, strongly criticised her stance.He said: “This is deeply disappointing, it suggests that sadly the secretary of state is massively out of touch with British public opinion on these issues and in fact the views of many farmers I talk to.”Ecosystems need lost species such as beavers to create habitats, and some such as pine martens to act as predators in the food chain, he added. “The fact is, ecosystems are not functioning as they should but where we have seen the reintroductions of beavers, of pine martens, you start to see these ecosystems are functioning properly.”On Coffey’s remarks about sea eagles being a threat to farmers, he said: “I think there are many misplaced concerns, I completely understand that whenever we look at species reintroductions there needs to be support among landowners and farmers.

This irreversible destruction violates our right to life, health, property and values ​​of the natural world.

Since then, emissions have continued to rise, and according to the International Energy Agency emissions will hit a record high by 2023 if green recovery fails. The newest report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that human-caused emissions have already contributed to irreversible changes in our climate system, and are rapidly moving us toward an uninhabitable planet.What we really need as world leaders gather for the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow is a global system change. A world built on business as usual is clearly falling apart – it has already for the most vulnerable.The world economy is reliant on constant growth and human exploitation in order to create profits. That’s why it is no surprise to see that a country’s rise in emissions correlates with its growth in GDP, energy consumption and pollution. But the capitalist growth model is incompatible with a zero-carbon world.By popularizing concepts such as “green growth” or “green capitalism”, world leaders sentence humanity to a life of dystopia. Ultimately, these proposals are the same concepts that brought us into this crisis in the first place, but in disguise.

He unveiled some long-awaited green policies, including a proposal for community renewable energy. The Labour leader also referenced the climate catastrophes that have swept the world this year, and reminded the audience “clean British energy is cheaper than foreign fossil fuels”.He also reiterated his commitment to keeping Britain’s net zero targets, saying: “When Rishi Sunak says roll back on our climate mission, I say speed ahead.”Starmer also promised more green spaces and pointed out it was under a Labour government that the first national park was designated.Some had feared the party would join a race to the bottom, trying to match Sunak’s vandalism of environmental policies. But the opposite has been true; climate underpins the policies of nearly all of those who would hold the great offices of state, and is a clear thread running through Labour’s electoral strategy.The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves reiterated plans for a more extensive windfall tax on fossil fuel companies. She also countered Conservative plans to use the planning rules to make it more difficult to install onshore wind and solar, pledging to write new planning documents that enshrine net zero at their heart.

Any rowing back on his already desperately inadequate plan would sever it completely.“If people inside BP are baulking at even this, which is so out of step with what’s needed to stay within habitable climate limits, it exposes the enormous gulf between what the industry is saying publicly and what they really think.”The International Energy Agency has said none of the oil supermajors are moving fast enough to prevent dangerous levels of global warming. Under Looney, BP had put a little more meat on the bones of the company’s net zero target. He increased investment in renewable energies, hired more clean-tech specialists, and astonished many industry analysts by stating the company did not expect to pump all of the fossil fuels in its reserves.Petroleum investors have been hard to convince. Despite record profits of $28bn last year, BP’s share price has performed poorly compared with rivals who have used the Ukraine war as an excuse to scale back their climate commitments and talk up the need for increased production.According to the Wall Street Journal, shares in BP have risen by about 7% since Looney became chief executive in February 2020, compared with a 25% climb for Shell. “However, Chevron, up 51%, and Exxon Mobil, which has gained 87%, leave both in the dust,” the report said.The pressure on Looney, 53, was evident earlier this year when he announced a watering down of his energy transition plan.",

Paddocked with sheep, they will kick and chase dogs and foxes that get too close to the lambs.There were 350,000 alpacas in Australia in 2021, according to a report by Agrifutures Australia, and, after a baby boom fuelled by ideal breeding conditions, the herd is on track to reach 400,000.Amee Dennis, who has 110 alpacas at her family farm in the central west of New South Wales, is among those who see the animals as a secondary income source. “We got our first alpacas close to five years ago, purely as guards for lambs,” Dennis said.“We did not know a single thing about an alpaca but we figured it [had] to be easier than sitting out every night with a spotlight trying to deal with the problem that way.” Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Now Dennis uses the alpaca fleeces to make fibre art. The farm, Quinton Park, offers tourists high tea with the alpacas. Visitors can also sponsor an animal.But most of their income comes from selling the fibre. “Even though the tourism side of our business has absolutely been growing and we’ve worked really hard to do that over the last couple of years, where we started was products and fibre, and that’s still where our main income comes from as far as the alpacas are concerned.”View image in fullscreenAlpaca farmer Amee Dennis and Sugar the baby alpaca in Tomingley, central west NSW. Photograph: Nicole Drew/Quinton Park AlpacasMost alpaca farms make their money from fibre. About 250,000 alpacas are used to produce fibre for sale, the Agrifutures report said, with each yielding about 5kg a year, suggesting an annual farmgate value of about $13.5m. The industry is worth $19.5m.The report added that the farmgate value had the potential to double if there was improved grower education and awareness of fibre market needs.",

The nests are designed to encourage the eagles to establish territories and breed in the coming years.The chair of the project, Michael Clarke, said: “We are delighted to see so many estates supporting the South of Scotland Golden Eagle project and recognising the importance of this iconic species. As a top predator, golden eagles help to maintain healthy ecosystems. They support the survival and prosperity of all healthy prey species, and are brilliant for ecotourism, too.”The Duke of Northumberland said he was thrilled that golden eagles had re-established themselves in southern Scotland.“It has been exciting to see these magnificent birds occupy a range close to Burncastle,” he said. “The estate was very keen to play a part in helping the birds, and the opportunity to build the eyries on Burncastle will hopefully raise the prospects of new chicks being born in the future.”One of the sub-adult birds seen in the area. Photograph: South of Scotland Golden Eagle ProjectIllegal persecution has brought the golden eagle to virtual extinction outside its Highlands stronghold. There were between two and four pairs of golden eagles across Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders before the project began in 2018. Scientists calculate there is habitat suitable for 16 pairs.According to the project’s manager, Dr Cat Barlow, estates including grouse moors have been keen to join the project because the eagles help to manage predators.“In the absence of golden eagles, predator species such as crows and foxes and even buzzards are probably at slightly abnormal levels.",

And, in this area, it’s probably going to be – for many, many farmers – devastating,” he said.“In other areas it will be good, but in this area, the breadbasket, it’s just … something that breaks my heart.”Afghanistan has had two brushes with the Moroccan locust in recent history, one in 1981, when an outbreak wiped out about a quarter of the national harvest, and another in 2003, when it claimed a more modest 8% due to a strengthened locust-control programme.However, since the Taliban overthrew Ashraf Ghani’s government, prompting foreign assistance to be cut off, the agriculture ministry’s locust-control programme has foundered. This has left the country vulnerable, as the Moroccan locust is ever present and only requires certain conditions for an outbreak to occur.People in Baghlan province, northern Afghanistan, use the traditional control method of digging pits to bury adolescent locusts before they grow into adults.",

However, it is with great regret that I must decline this opportunity,” she wrote.In her letter, published by Athletics Weekly, she said: “When I started running, the prospect of me competing in the world cross country championships would have seemed merely a dream. However, the reality of the travel fills me with deep concern.“I was just nine when the Cop21 Paris climate agreement was signed.

Now a study suggests similar labelling on food could help them make wiser choices about not just their health, but the health of the planet.The research, by academics at Durham University, found that warning labels including a graphic image – similar to those warning of impotence, heart disease or lung cancer on cigarette packets – could reduce selections of meals containing meat by 7-10%.It is a change that could have a material impact on the future of the planet. According to a recent YouGov poll, 72% of the UK population classify themselves as meat-eaters.

It has suggested the government considers offering more support this winter.More than 46,400 people asked Citizens Advice for support in the first six months of this year, marking a 17% rise compared with the same period last year.On average, those contacting the charity had about £1,711 worth of unpaid energy bills, with analysis showing disabled people and families with young children were the most likely to be struggling with high levels of debt.The sector regulator, Ofgem, recently estimated that the collective gas and electricity debt owed by UK consumers was about £2.3bn. Nearly 8 million people had to borrow money to pay their energy bills in the first half of 2023, a number Citizens Advice expects to rise over the coming months.On Friday Ofgem will announce a new energy price cap, which forecasters have predicted will keep the typical annual household bill at the equivalent of about £1,823 from October, although much of that change will be the result of a new formula that assumes lower gas and electricity usage. Under the current formula, the cap will be equivalent to £1,925.However, that cap level will still mean the about 29 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland that it applies to are paying roughly 40% more than they were two years ago, before supplies were disrupted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.With households not entitled to the £400 support they received last winter, split into monthly payments between October and April, Citizens Advice warned that millions of people were facing a winter as bad as last winter, or even worse.",

Documents show that JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, and allies including the Global Dairy Platform, planned to make arguments in favour of livestock farming with “full force”. While the sincerity of fossil-fuel businesses’ commitment to a green transition has long been doubted, they are not the only energy-intensive businesses to approach Cop28 as an opportunity to promote their activities – rather than a threat.While the ostensible purpose is to safeguard the planet for the future, the fear is that the Cop process has been captured by the short-term interests of carbon-emitting industries that will do anything to protect their wealth. This year’s gathering is hosted by Sultan Al Jaber, the chief executive of the UAE’s national oil company.In petro-states such as the UAE, the economic interests of rulers and fossil-fuel businesses are the same. But other rich nations with more mixed economies are also culpable. On Friday Rishi Sunak gave a speech that sought to justify his disgraceful watering-down of green measures on the grounds that they would cost people “thousands of pounds” – with no mention of expected savings. Meanwhile, in the US, fossil fuel extraction is surging, despite the support for renewables in the Inflation Reduction Act.So far the Cop process has failed to reduce the amount of carbon being pumped into the atmosphere, although the rate of increase has slowed. The remaining carbon budget – the amount that can be emitted while holding on to a 50% chance of staying within the 1.5C limit – stands at 250bn tonnes. One key question for negotiators in Dubai is how that budget is allocated. Another is how the people and ecosystems most harmed by global heating will be helped.On the latter, there has been some progress with the establishment of a loss and damage fund. But the battle over the continued production of fossil fuels, and the future of carbon-intensive industries such as animal agriculture and aviation, is raging.

In a ruling handed down on Monday, Lady Justice Carr, leading a panel of three appeal court judges, disagreed.“This protest was of a wholly different nature and scale to the many non-violent protests of conscientious activists up and down the country exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly on a daily basis,” Carr said.Carr admitted the sentences were severe. “But we have concluded that they were not manifestly excessive; nor did they amount to a disproportionate interference with their rights of freedom of expression and assembly.”“This was very serious offending by repeat protest offenders who were trespassers (and on bail) at the time; whilst the protest was non-violent as such, it had extreme consequences for many, many members of the public.”She said the sentences met the “legitimate” aim of deterring others from such offending.At a hearing last Wednesday, Daniel Friedman KC, representing Trowland and Decker, had said their jail terms were “the longest ever handed down in a case of non-violent protest in this country in modern times”.He told the court they had spent nine months in jail since their arrest last October, which amounted to the “longest sentence ever served in living memory” for someone convicted over a “peaceful protest”. The sentences were, Friedman had argued, a “disproportionate interference” with the activists’ rights to free speech and protest, and were likely to have “a chilling effect” on all protest.",

The global stocktake is a process mandated under the Paris agreement, intended to check every five years on countries’ progress on meeting their emissions-cutting goals.Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief, said the report offered a range of actions for governments to consider. “[These are] clear targets which provide a north star for the action that is required by countries,” he said.Greenhouse gas emissions are still rising but there is broad agreement they must peak by 2025 at the latest if there is to be a chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C.“This is a major opportunity being presented for the course correction that is so urgently called for,” Stiell said. “[The report] lays out elements that can be incorporated into a response.” But while most countries agreed on the need to change direction, he said, there was “significant divergence” on how to achieve the changes needed.Other proposals in the report include a tripling of renewable energy capacity and a doubling of energy efficiency globally by 2030. It was the second of two documents that will underpin discussions at Cop28.

In the Pavia area of the Po valley the water level is 3 metres below the zero gauge, turning the riverbanks into beaches – a phenomenon usually seen in summer.“Nothing has changed since 2022,” said Luca Mercalli, the president of the Italian Meteorological Society. “We are still in a situation of deficit … let’s wait for the spring, which is usually the rainiest period for the Po valley. There is a good possibility that rainfall in April and May can compensate – it’s the last hope. If we have no spring rain for two consecutive years then it would be the first time this has ever happened.”The Po also flows through Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, one of the most important agricultural zones in Europe. Along with 2022, during which there was a protracted heatwave, the valley experienced droughts in 2007, 2012 and 2017, and scientists say their growing prevalence is a further indication of the climate crisis.Coldiretti, Italy’s biggest farmers’ association, said the 2022 drought caused €6bn (£5.4bn) worth of damage to agricultural produce.

While there are no current sustainable solutions to aviation, as players we are setting an example and taking a tangible step in the right direction.”Pedersen has quickly been able to get a large following from other footballers taking part in the World Cup this year, with Chelsea’s Fleming one of them. “This is a topic I feel passionate about, and I hope this action my teammates and I are taking accelerates the climate conversation and sets a precedent for what athletes can do to push for more environmental policies in football,” Fleming told the Guardian.Taking part in the campaign, she said, was an “easy initiative to get excited about because it’s a good way of drawing attention to the issue of the carbon footprint associated with these tournaments”.The project not only looks to have a positive effect in regards to the climate as a whole but also to leave a lasting impact on supporters of the World Cup. Fleming said that she hopes the initiative will show fans, especially younger supporters, that football “means using your voice to advocate things that are important for you”.",

Officials said the state would release its own plan.The Colorado River and its tributaries pass through seven states and into Mexico, serving 40 million people and a $5bn-a-year agricultural industry. Some of the largest cities in the country, including Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver and Las Vegas, two Mexican states, Native American tribes and others depend on the river, which has been severely stressed by drought, demand and overuse.States missed a mid-August deadline to heed the US Bureau of Reclamation’s call to propose ways to conserve 2m to 4m acre-feet of water. They regrouped to reach consensus by the end of January to fold into a larger proposal Reclamation has in the works.Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming sent a letter on Monday to Reclamation, which operates the major dams in the river system, to outline an alternative that builds on existing guidelines, deepens water cuts and factors in water that is lost through evaporation and transportation.Those states propose raising the levels where water reductions would be triggered at Lake Mead and Lake Powell, which are barometers of the river’s health. The model creates more of a protective buffer for both reservoirs – the largest built in the US. It also seeks to fix water accounting and ensure that any water the Lower Basin states intentionally stored in Lake Mead is available for future use.The modeling would result in about 2m acre-feet of cuts in the Lower Basin, with smaller reductions in the Upper Basin. Mexico and California are factored into the equations, but neither signed on to Monday’s letter.John Entsminger, general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said all states have been negotiating in good faith. “I don’t view not having unanimity at one step in that process to be a failure,” he said late on Monday. “I think all seven states are still committed to working together.”California released a proposal last October to cut 400,000 acre-feet.",

Scientists noted that the sensitivity of their instruments is now higher.“It’s really concerning that we are finding microplastics in every sample, from coastal areas to the most remote regions of the ocean,” said Victoria Fulfer, a visiting scientist from the University of Rhode Island at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) in the UK. “We are seeing much higher concentrations this year, which can be a sign of increased pollution, but also is related to the increased sensitivity of our analysis.”The samples were collected during the initial legs of the race, which started in January and finishes in July, passing through the South Atlantic Ocean near a location considered to be the farthest from land anywhere on Earth.The 45 samples collected from leg two, running from Cabo Verde to South Africa, showed microplastic concentrations from 92-1,884, while in leg three – between Cape Town and Itajaí, Brazil – the concentrations ranged from 160-1,492 per cubic metre.A filter on the boats can pick up plastic particles measuring between 0.03mm and 5mm. The samples are sent daily to the NOC for analysis, with support from the University of Rhode Island.The highest concentrations of microplastics were found close to coasts and urban areas, such as readings of 816-1,712 per cubic metre off the coast of South Africa, and also in the “garbage patch” areas of the sea, where currents cause plastic to accumulate. Concentrations during the 2017-18 Ocean Race ranged from 50-100 per cubic metre.Samples taken near the planet’s most remote area, Point Nemo, which is 2,688km (1,450 nautical miles) from land in all directions, revealed 320 microplastic particles per cubic metre, compared with 9-41 in the last race.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

Previous studies quantifying the death toll from air pollution assumed all PM2.5 sources posed the same risk, and therefore probably underestimated the dangers of coal plants.‘Insanity’: petrostates planning huge expansion of fossil fuels, says UN reportRead moreGovernment regulations save lives, according to the research, which is published in Science, as most deaths happened when environmental standards were weakest and PM2.5 levels from coal-fired power stations highest.“Air pollution from coal is much more harmful than we thought, and we’ve been treating it like it’s just another air pollutant,” said the lead author, Lucas Henneman, an assistant professor in the Sid and Reva Dewberry department of civil, environmental and infrastructure engineering at George Mason University. “This type of evidence is important to policymakers like EPA [the US Environmental Protection Agency] as they identify cost-effective solutions for cleaning up the country’s air, like requiring emissions controls or encouraging renewables.”Henneman led a group of researchers who used publicly available data to track air pollution – and its health effects – from the 480 US coal power plants that operated at some point between 1999 and 2020. A model was used to track the wind direction and reach of the toxins from each power station. Annual exposure levels were then connected with more than 650m Medicare health records that covered most people over age 65 in the US.The coal plants associated with most deaths were located east of the Mississippi River in industrialized states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, where power stations were historically constructed close to population hubs.",

Apart from their damp beauty, they are home to rare wildlife, act as a water filter and a ballast against flooding, and, perhaps most crucially of all, are a somewhat unsung hero of the battle with the climate crisis given their carbon-capturing power. Peat bogs are Scotland’s largest carbon store.That combination of attributes means peatlands have long been an environmental cause celebre, and explains why even this most part-time, pallidly green of governments has at last seen a reason to protect them, with the most high-profile piece of legislation so far being a ban on peat products for domestic gardeners, which will see composting products – already pretty much infra dig – entirely absent from garden centres by the end of 2024.It’s also why the scotch whisky industry is starting to feel a little nervous about how long its own relationship with peat can continue. Don’t forget, whisky and peat go back centuries together, a partnership which, for lovers of a peaty dram, is as precious and remarkable as anything else to do with peat: when barley is malted above a peat fire, it gives the resulting whisky that distinctive, damp-earthy-smoky flavour which many would argue is the quintessence of scotch.As well as making the point that whisky accounts for only about 1% of the UK’s peat use, defending the cultural significance of this tradition has been the central pillar of the scotch industry’s case during the Scottish government’s consultation on its peat policy this year. Pledges to make peat use more sustainable have also been part of the lobbying mix – although the idea that peat use can ever be truly sustainable given the glacial pace of regeneration (1mm a year) is a matter of some debate.Would an outright ban on industrial peat use in the short or medium term, which some producers fear may be the result of the consultation, spell the end of scotch as we know it?",

Many cannot be grown in the UK at scale. The former category includes cauliflowers, broccoli and strawberries. It also includes nearly two-thirds of the cucumbers and tomatoes imported to the UK, and nearly a fifth of the overall supply of onions.Additionally, more than half of the UK’s lemons and sweet peppers come from the Mediterranean, along with two-thirds of all oranges and 40% of table grapes. Olive oil is also affected by extreme temperatures; the UK gets 80% of its supplies from the region. This year, it has been one of the foodstuffs with the sharpest increases in price, adding to inflation.According to the report, in 2022 just over a quarter of UK food imports – 9.8bn kg, worth just over £16bn – came from the Mediterranean region, mostly fresh fruit and vegetables. Spain, which is experiencing some of the worst extreme heat and drought, accounted for 7% of UK food imports – worth £4bn.Gareth Redmond-King, the head of international programme at the Energy & Climate intelligence Unit, said: “As well as a climate crisis, we’re in a public health crisis too. Most of us already don’t eat enough fruit and veg, and often healthier diets already tend to cost more.

The overall report is “frustrating”, said Scott Faber, senior vice-president of government affairs with EWG.“The Department of Defense is trying to downplay these risks rather than aggressively seeking to notify service members and clean up its legacy pollution,” he said. “It has long history of looking the other way when it comes to PFAS pollution.”The DoD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.PFAS are a class of about 12,000 chemicals often used to make products resist water, stain and heat. They are called forever chemicals because they do not naturally break down and persist in the environment. The chemicals are linked to cancer, liver disease, high cholesterol, thyroid disorders, birth defects and autoimmune dysfunction.PFAS are thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million people nationally, and contamination has been found in and around hundreds of DoD bases at high levels because the chemicals are the main ingredient in firefighting foam the military uses.Congress mandated the DoD report in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, but the military has not published it on the department’s PFAS website, so it is unavailable to the public or service members except upon request.“That’s the part that ought to bother every American,” Faber said.",

The Wombles recycled rubbish, singing: “Pick up the pieces and make them into something new / Is what we do.” Bagpuss was an expert in thrift: “We will fix it like new, new, new,” sang the mice. As a teenager, instead of buying new, I embraced the 1970s revival of handicrafts and made my own leather bags, floaty skirts and bead jewellery. Cars were a rarity and I travelled by bus, bike or on foot and got to know my neighbours.Reducing our carbon footprint could take us back to the 1970s. But would that be completely bad?

The fashion industry is a major contributor to climate change; its carbon footprint exceeds that of international flights and maritime shipping combined. The UK government’s recent report on fast fashion makes a fitting and appalling comparison to the carbon footprint of all EU member states (3.5bn tonnes). The dyeing, finishing and washing of clothes also generates excessive water waste.The crisis in materials as well as changing consumer sentiment makes me question the role of renowned events such as the Met Gala in curbing climate change.

Last year, the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said subsidising and burning fossil fuels was “an act of self-sabotage”.Echoing his words, Neira said there was no longer any way for public health experts to escape debates around energy.

More than 4,500 people died in England in 2022 due to high temperatures, which was the largest figure on record. Between 1988 and 2022, almost 52,000 deaths associated with the hottest days were recorded in England, with a third of them occurring since 2016, data from the Office for National Statistics shows. During the same 35-year period analysed, more than 2,000 people died in Wales due to the warm temperatures.Drawing on advice from experts from a range of organisations including the National Infrastructure Commission, the London School of Economics and the University of Oxford, the Fabians have drawn up a plan to prevent illness and death from the increasing extreme heat predicted to happen in the UK due to climate breakdown.These include introducing a specific maximum indoor working temperature law, including the ability to withdraw labour if workplace temperatures surpass 30C, or 27C if doing strenuous work.It found that “low-paid workers often lack sufficient access to water, can not escape the heat, and have to wear uniforms or personal protective equipment (PPE) designed for cooler temperatures.” Hospitality and manual workers are most likely to face excessive heat, but also employees in education establishments and offices can suffer if they are working on higher floors or in areas with big windows and poor ventilation. Workers in better-off households are less likely to work in jobs where they are at risk of overheating.A duty should also be put on landlords to prevent overheated homes, based on the existing requirements for landlords to prevent cold homes, the authors said.",

Dingoes are classified as native species in all jurisdictions on the Australian mainland.“It’s just not acceptable for a native species to be … killed in the manner that we’re doing in national parks – and that is happening pretty much all across the country,” Cairns said. “There is no other native animal that is managed the way dingoes are in Australia.”The letter to the NSW government details “extensive lethal control activities including aerial baiting, ground baiting, aerial shooting, ground shooting and trapping being carried out across national parks and conservation areas for the management of ‘wild dogs’”.“A lot of people think that dingoes are different from ‘wild dogs’ when the government use of the term includes dingoes,” Cairns said.“The terminology ‘wild dogs’ has been adopted because of concern that there’s a lot of hybridisation going on in populations. But the science is now saying: we don’t actually have that many of those mixed animals, there are basically no feral dogs and there are very few hybrids that have very little dingo ancestry.“We need to change the terminology so that it’s clear and transparent what animals are being targeted for lethal control in different areas, and also so that we can have a more open discussion about how we’re going to balance the protection of a native species [with] managing them in places where they may be causing issues for agriculture.",

This was a decline from the previous year’s statistics that showed that 97% met the minimum standard of “sufficient”, while 93% met the highest standards of good and excellent.The vast majority of designated bathing sites are coastal, and only three rivers in England have the special designation for swimming: the River Wharfe at Ilkley, Wolvercote Mill Stream in Oxfordshire and the Deben estuary at Waldringfield. All three have been given poor status, meaning people should not swim in them and risk getting sick if they do. Sewage spills and agricultural runoff mean that swimming sites can carry E coli and intestinal enterococci, which would make swimmers ill.Many European countries designate a far greater number rivers as swimming areas.

Sadly, that tells its own story, that the UK’s rivers are in a very fragile state. Today, only 14% of the UK’s rivers are considered healthy. Many others like the iconic River Wye are so polluted they are at risk of ecocide.”England to diverge from EU water monitoring standardsRead moreThe data is focused solely on the 400 sites designated for swimming during the spring and summer months, from 15 May to 30 September. These are usually the driest times of year, when sewage is least likely to be spilled, as overflows are supposed to happen only during heavy rain when sewers are overwhelmed. However, analysis has found that water companies sometimes dump sewage during dry weather when they are not legally supposed to.",

His fatal expedition last year to interview Indigenous defenders fighting criminal activity in the Javari valley was to have been one of his final reporting trips.In a tribute to the deep admiration Phillips elicited as both a person and journalist, his friends and colleagues are now striving to ensure that his work telling the stories of Amazon defenders does not die with him.His widow, Alessandra Sampaio, asked a group of writers from Brazil, the US and the UK to finish the book Phillips started, which he had pitched as a “character-driven, deeply researched, campaigning, environmental travel book that aims to entertain, inform and, most importantly, mobilise readers” about the fate of the Amazon.“Amid the horror that followed the news of Bruno and Dom’s death, we wanted to focus on something positive, and the most important thing we could think of was to complete the work that Dom had started,” said Jonathan Watts, one of the journalists coordinating the book’s route to publication. “Good journalism mustn’t be silenced.”As well as Watts, who is global environment writer for the Guardian and co-founder of the Amazon-based news site Sumaúma, the team of experienced Amazon writers includes Eliane Brum (author and co-founder of Sumaúma), Tom Phillips (Latin America correspondent for the Guardian), Jon Lee Anderson (staff writer for the New Yorker), Katia Brasil (founder of Amazônia Real) and Andrew Fishman (president and co-founder of the Intercept Brasil).",

I find myself thinking of a six-year-old boy called Desmond I met in Turkana county, Kenya, who died from severe acute malnutrition on the same day. His death was the result of a climate-induced drought that has left millions of people on the brink of starvation in the Horn of Africa.I want the negotiators deciding the outcome of Cop28 to know Desmond’s story. Because in the end, the climate crisis is not about pledges, statistics, reports or activists. It’s about human suffering and ruined lives. It’s about death.Right now in Dubai, the world’s countries are negotiating what to do about fossil fuels. Some governments, such as those from small-island nations, are leading the push. Some, including the likes of Saudi Arabia, are blocking any meaningful progress.Over the weekend, there was a glimmer of hope. It looked like an agreement on phasing out all fossil fuels might just be possible. However, the latest draft of the global stocktake, released on Monday, showed a text that has been gutted of all references to oil or gas. References to “phasing out fossil fuels” have also been obliterated. The weak fossil-fuel cuts it does refer to are now presented as optional for countries – using the word “could” rather than “must”. There is also no mention of the need for developed countries to help finance the energy transition in developing countries.Selfish, short-sighted actors are once again sabotaging our collective fate in the name of profit. We know this: last week, Opec sent a letter to its oil-producing member countries asking them to block any progress on fossil fuel phase-out.It hardly needs repeating at this point, but the science is very clear. The only credible way to keep 1.5ºC alive is through a fast and just phase-out of all fossil fuels.The wording of the current draft also opens up loopholes for more pollution, like the undefined word “abatement”. We know that such language will tacitly condone increases in fossil-fuel production for years to come, with the pretence of relying on fairytale technologies such as carbon capture and storage.",

It was also the same one taken in August 1873 by French painter Gabriel Loppé, whose climb inspired Hart Dyke’s own.“Loppé was a legendary painter of the Alps, and the peaks he saw and captured on his canvases are now disappearing,” said Hart Dyke. “I wanted to capture them again, partly to show the damage that’s already been done, and partly to share one more glimpse of Europe’s best-known mountain range before it disappears for ever.”Within the next few years, he said, no painter – or anyone else – will be able to make the climb. “The glaciers are melting so fast that as you cross, there’s a kind of rippling effect on the surface that makes it almost impossible to walk on.“The bottoms of the glaciers have completely deteriorated: where Loppé saw pristine blue-white snow, I was looking at dirt and black ice.”The painting Death Mask by James Hart Dyke depicts the pinnacle of a glacier on Mont Blanc where the ice has completely disappeared. Photograph: James Hart DykeAs Hart Dyke climbed, rocks were becoming dislodged around him. “The ice sticks everything together, so now it’s melting, the rocks are coming away and the possibility of an avalanche is very high.”Hart Dyke’s Mont Blanc paintings will be exhibited in London at Cromwell Place, South Kensington, later this month alongside those of Loppé, highlighting the difference the climate crisis has made to the glaciers and the mountain.Among 40 paintings by Hart Dyke will be one entitled Death Mask, which shows a serac, or glacier pinnacle, whose ice has disappeared completely. “It’s black and ominous and it reminds me of the dark works of Goya, which also had a message about devastation and decline,” he said.",

The most important thing is to use organic bananas, to avoid pesticides and fungicides. The second most important thing is that your banana skins are super-ripe, with large brown spots, which will guarantee a sweeter end result.Your bananacon should be eaten immediately, but any leftover marinade can be reused or added to a stew to enhance its umami flavours.

In a separate report published on Tuesday, Climate Action Tracker (CAT) raised its projections slightly for future warming above the estimates it made at a conference in Glasgow two years ago.Graphic“Two years after Glasgow, our report is virtually the same,” said Claire Stockwell, an analyst at Climate Analytics and lead author of the CAT report. “You would think the extreme events around the world would be sparking action but governments appear oblivious, somehow thinking treading water will deal with the flood of impacts.”As carbon clogs the atmosphere, trapping sunlight and baking the planet, the climate is growing more hostile to human life. The growth in CO2 emissions had slowed substantially over the past decade, the Global Carbon Project found, but the amount emitted each year had continued to rise. It projected that total CO2 emissions in 2023 would reach a record high of 40.9 gigatons.If the world continued to emit CO2 at that rate, the international team of more than 120 scientists found, it would burn through the remaining carbon budget for a half-chance of keeping global heating to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures in just seven years. In 15 years, the scientists estimated, the budget for 1.7C would be gone too.00:02:34Cop28 president hits back after outcry over remarks on fossil fuels – video reportThe researchers reported big regional differences in emissions.

Indeed, Keir Starmer has said of them ‘just go home’ because they are not actually promoting the cause of tackling climate change. What they are doing is entirely counterproductive and the only debate it’s provoking is about our public order laws.”But he said Vince was a “perfectly legitimate person to take money from”.Speaking to the same programme, Vince defended Just Stop Oil’s tactics. “Sometimes laws are unjust and when that happens people have to stand up and do something about it.

This landscaped sweep, one of the first public parks in England, was only open to the public on Sundays and Wednesdays. For the rest of the week, its fountains and pathways were reserved for paying customers, whose entry fees effectively subsidised the park.The system was scrapped in 1882, as the growing concern for public health among Victorian reformers accelerated the creation of open public parks in towns and cities across England. Anyone can now stroll through Derby’s arboretum. But another form of gatekeeping is taking place in parks today. Councils that have seen their budgets eviscerated by austerity are finding ways to turn parks into cash-generating assets, often by renting stretches of the land to fenced-off commercial events.These deals can be mutually beneficial, particularly when the park is sizable and locals are consulted. They can also resemble a destructive form of temporary privatisation. Earlier this month, Haringey council in north London rented part of Finsbury Park to Tough Mudder, a popular obstacle course and run for adults. Initiatives that encourage outdoor exercise are welcome, but the scale and nature of the event drew criticism after hundreds of racers churned up mud and trampled a community orchard. The company has apologised and Tough Mudder will not return to the park. The council should have foreseen the damage. After visiting the scene, the local MP David Lammy called it an “environmental disgrace”.Races and festivals generate income that councils can reinvest in park maintenance, but they can also wall off areas of parkland, making them less accessible for locals. As one resident wrote in the Guardian, other events held in Finsbury Park have required 37 industrial-sized generators and a three-metre high fence. This reliance on commercial income isn’t limited to London. Residents in Swansea and Manchester have complained about frequent fenced-off events. Councils find themselves in a difficult position. Parks are a discretionary service, and so they are vulnerable to cost-cutting. Local authority funding has shrunk by £15bn in real terms since 2010.",

But it is already clear that the wind-fuelled blaze which last week ripped through the historic town of Lahaina was the deadliest wildfire in the United States for more than 100 years.Hundreds are still missing, and the sheer intensity of the fire means that the identification of bodies and the notification of relatives will be a difficult and slow process. The west Maui town itself, the former capital of the Hawaiian kingdom, is a charred wasteland in which close to 3,000 structures were burned to the ground at terrifying speed.Along with the grim process of recovering the dead, finding viable accommodation for the survivors is the immediate priority. In the weeks ahead, tourists will hopefully heed pleas from the Hawaii Tourism Authority and stay away from the rest of the island. Hotel space and Airbnb accommodation will be needed for first responders and evacuees, not holidaymakers. Reconstruction will then be a laborious process costing many billions of dollars.Lessons will also need to be learned in the wake of the worst natural disaster in Hawaii’s history. As climate-related disasters become more frequent, more unpredictable and intensively destructive, a step change is needed in how governments and societies respond to the threat. In this regard, state authorities in Hawaii appear to have been badly behind the curve. An emergency management plan, published by state officials last year, identified tsunamis, earthquakes and volcanic hazards as potentially deadly threats, but described the risk of wildfires to human life as “low”. That judgment now looks culpably complacent.Record-breaking temperatures in recent years, combined with forest loss and abandoned farmland featuring more combustible non-native grasses, had turned parts of Maui into a virtual tinderbox. A previous report stated that a 2018 brush fire, which forced residents to evacuate homes and burned more than 2,000 acres of land, should be a “real world wake-up call”. As was the case in last week’s catastrophe, that blaze occurred in drought conditions, amid high winds from a hurricane traversing the Pacific Ocean.",

When I investigated the pollution sources in the 2019 and 2020 dataset, I also found arsenic among the chemicals from wood smoke.”Despite clear messages from government and local councils, a survey for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2018-19 revealed that about 9% of people who burned wood at home were burning waste wood.The problem is that construction wood is normally treated with preservatives to protect against insects and fungi. Before 2006 the preservatives used in the UK frequently contained arsenic. This arsenic becomes part of the ash and smoke when the wood is burned.The survey found examples of people burning fence panels, pallets, old furniture, doors, door frames and construction wood salvaged from skips. One woman described how her husband collected waste wood from skips using a wheelbarrow.Many people in the survey did not know what types of wood might be treated and others justified their behaviour as harmless because they only did it occasionally. Another mistakenly thought their Defra-approved stove would remove any toxins.And this problem is not isolated to London. Dr James Allan, who operates Manchester University’s air research site, said: “We see arsenic in Manchester as well, associated with cold weather and the black carbon that you get from wood-burning.”In Auckland, New Zealand, scientists have been investigating if people in the city were being exposed to arsenic from wood-heating. Many New Zealanders pride themselves on finding and burning free wood. Despite official warnings, almost 20% of homes routinely burn construction wood. This can lead to airborne arsenic concentrations that are double the UK and EU legal limits.As part of the research, 30 men were asked to grow beards for two weeks, then shave and collect the hair for analysis.",

The latest data from the Environment Agency (EA) showed on Friday that discharges of raw sewage from storm overflows into English rivers and coastal waters happened 825 times a day last year.United Utilities, which covers the north-west of England, was responsible for 69,000 spills last year, including a site in Cumbria that discharged sewage more than 300 times.On Tuesday the government will announce a “plan for water” that it claims will set out how to achieve cleaner and more plentiful water. The scale of problems ranges from pollution of every English river from sewage and agricuture, to the reality of water shortages as the climate crisis leads to droughts across the UK.

But new research suggests that by eating some parts of the coral and then pooing in different areas of the reef, they are part of a cycle that redistributes beneficial microbes that can help coral thrive.“Corallivorous fish are generally regarded as harmful because they bite the corals. But it turns out that this doesn’t tell the whole story,” said Dr Carsten Grupstra, of Rice University, the lead author of the study. “They often get a bad rep, and lots of scientists see them as damaging. But I hope this work shows that they can be a part of a healthy ecosystem.“Corallivore faeces contain many of the bacterial taxa that associate with healthy corals under normal conditions, potentially resulting in the natural dispersal of ‘coral probiotics’, analogous to faecal microbiota transplantation therapy in humans.”This means that when some fish faeces interact with coral colonies on the reef, and these microorganisms are transferred from the poo to a new coral colony, they can be beneficial to that new coral colony.The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science this week, looked at the different impacts of grazer fish, which consume algae and detritus. Until now it had been assumed that they contributed to reef health, but the study found faeces from grazers, which contain disease pathogens, can leave dying patches, known as lesions, on corals.00:01:55Why we need to stop killing coral reefs: underwater in Egypt – videoThe scientists examined the impact of faeces from corallivore and grazer fish and found that the grazers caused lesions or death in all coral pieces, whereas faeces from corallivores caused fewer and smaller lesions and rarely caused death. Moreover, the corallivore faeces helped disperse helpful microbes, keeping the reefs healthy.The research was done to determine what types of bacteria were contributing to the impacts noticed on the coral, whether the excrement included specific coral diseases, and whether the results of the faeces addition experiment could be applied to other fish that ate coral, algae and detritus.",

It then increased to 1.6% in 2021, but remained below the level seen almost a decade earlier..The report highlighted cuts to government support for green projects under Cameron, who was reported to have told aides in November 2013 to “get rid of all the green crap” from energy bills.At the time, his team said they did not recognise the phrase, but did not issue an explicit denial, and it came to symbolise the sea change from his previous claim to be leading “the greenest government ever”.The government then went on to scrap or cut the funding for a wide range of green policies, including support for onshore wind, solar power subsidies and help for homeowners to bring down their energy bills by installing insulation.The report said the fall in green job opportunities “coincided with removal of funding for various supply-and-demand-side energy schemes from 2012-13 and the decline in broader climate policies during this period.“While our analysis cannot attribute a causal link between these trends and policy developments, the decline in the earlier part of the sample period coincides with a decline in policy support for renewables and broader climate initiatives.”It said the more recent increase correlated with renewed government focus on green policies, including Theresa May’s pledge to hit net zero carbon emissions by 2050, her industrial clean-growth strategy and Boris Johnson’s 10-point green plan.Rishi Sunak is under pressure over his support for greening the economy, amid accusations that he lacks the commitment of his predecessor.",

They are designed as one unit so batteries cannot be separated from the plastic.The organisation said the lithium batteries inside the plastic can sharply increase in temperature if crushed and can become flammable. This costs taxpayers money through fire damage to equipment and the specialist treatment needed to deal with hazardous waste.Last year, research by Material Focus – a non-profit organisation which runs the Recycle Your Electricals campaign – found that about 1.3m single-use vapes are thrown away each week in the UK – an extraordinary rise since the first was sold in 2019. Their work found that more than 700 fires in bin lorries and recycling centres were caused by batteries that had been dumped into general waste.Last month, recycling firms said they were dealing with so many vapes that they were struggling to insure their facilities. Some are using artificial intelligence to detect vapes, as well as installing thermal imaging cameras and automatic foam jets.The warning comes days after children’s doctors called for an outright ban on disposable vapes to reduce their popularity among young people as the long-term impact remains unknown.Dr Mike McKean, the RCPH vice-president and a paediatric respiratory consultant, said the college had made a “very carefully considered call”, amid concern from its members about an “epidemic” of child vaping.

They are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and they have been linked to cancer, high cholesterol, liver disease, kidney disease, fetal complications and other serious health problems.The new study analyzed data from three studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at different periods since 2013.The EPA found all but one of the 501 samples it checked had elevated PFAS levels. Farmed freshwater fish typically had significantly lower levels of PFAS than wild caught, which David Andrews, one of the study’s coauthors, said might be due to farms using groundwater as a source to fill ponds instead of contaminated rivers or lakes.The highest levels were found in several species of bass and catfish, while the lowest relative levels were found in chinook and coho salmon.

But, despite their importance, there has been no long-term monitoring of soil invertebrates.To fill the gap, researchers collated data from more than 100 different smaller studies ranging from 1928 to 2018. From this they estimated a decline in earthworm abundance of between 33% and 41% in the last quarter of a century, the period for which the best data was available.The research is being presented at the British Ecological Society’s annual meeting in Edinburgh on Monday and is being peer-reviewed for publication.“It’s looking like there is evidence of a long-term decline,” said Prof James Pearce-Higgins, the director of science at the British Trust for Ornithology, which conducted the research. “A large-scale decline in soil biodiversity – particularly the loss of earthworms – would sit alongside concerns about ‘insectaggedon’ and the wider biodiversity crisis.“It would have widespread impacts on the species that feed on soil invertebrates, like birds, but also affect soil processing and nutrient cycling, the whole functioning of our ecosystems,” he said. “Thrushes, starlings and many waders that rely on soil invertebrates are in long-term decline. These declines are greatest in south-east England where hotter, drier summers may also reduce the availability of earthworms to foraging birds.”Dr Ailidh Barnes, also at the BTO, said there were good reasons to expect declines in earthworms on farmland. “Changes in the UK countryside over the last century, such as extensive drainage, pesticide use and inorganic fertiliser application, are likely to have negatively affected earthworm populations.” Repeated ploughing was also likely to cause harm.The scientists scoured thousands of studies to find those containing suitable data. They then took account of differences in the methods used to provide the best window into the past available in the absence of a formal monitoring programme. They found earthworm declines appeared greatest on farmland and in broadleaved woodlands. Wilder upland areas, further from human activity, were less affected.",

But when responsibility for emissions in countries once under the British empire’s rule is given to the UK, the figure rises to more than 5%.These additional emissions come largely from the destruction of forests in the colonised countries, with the biggest contributors coming from India, Myanmar and Nigeria before their independence.The analysis by Carbon Brief moves up the UK from eighth to fourth in the list of nations with the biggest historical emissions, behind the US, China and Russia.The climate crisis, which has led to temperature records being shattered in 2023, is predominantly the result of carbon emissions from rich nations. However, the worst impacts of intensifying extreme weather are hitting poorer nations, which have very low emissions.The issue of responsibility features strongly in the international UN climate negotiations, which resume again at Cop28 in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.It is especially important in debate over the provision of climate finance to developing nations. A new “loss and damage” fund will be a critical matter of contention at the summit.British empire colonial emissionsDr Simon Evans, at Carbon Brief, said: “Our new analysis offers a thought-provoking fresh perspective on questions of climate justice. It is well known that colonial powers extracted natural resources from colonised lands to support their economic and political power, but the link to historical emissions had never been quantified until now.“Our findings reinforce the significant historical responsibility of developed countries for current warming, particularly the former colonial powers in Europe.“Many of these countries now have declining emissions. Yet their relative wealth today – and their historical contributions to current warming – are recognised within the international climate regime as being tied to a responsibility to support the climate response in less developed countries.”Historical emissions are significant because there is a direct relationship between the amount of carbon dioxide released over time and the level of heating at the Earth’s surface, said Evans.",

They are just one of the 240 species of solitary bees in Britain, and are just as important for pollination as the one species of honeybee. Each has different shaped mouthparts, which have evolved alongside flowers with different access routes to their nectar so that the plants are more likely to be pollinated from the same species. And you don’t have to farm the solitaries. This type needs only fine, sandy soil so they can dig deep burrows (and surprisingly quickly too with their tiny legs). They make side chambers and lay one egg in each, with a small supply of nectar and pollen.

And so today I announced a change of direction: I am no longer going to fund Just Stop Oil. Under the current government, protest cannot work. I would go so far as to say that anything that could feed the Tories’ culture-war narrative is counter-productive.“The dividing lines have been drawn: Labour is green, the Tories are not. A vote for anyone other than Labour, or no vote at all, is a vote for another Tory government – this time with a mandate to pursue its anti-green crusade. Preventing that from happening is the only way to ‘just stop oil’.”As well as funding direct action protest groups, Vince has given at least £1.5m to Labour over the past decade. His funding for both had led to accusations from the prime minister that “eco-zealots” were writing the opposition’s energy policies.Labour has said that if elected it would grant no new licences for oil and gas projects, a key demand of Just Stop Oil, as well as begin a programme of retrofit insulation for 19m homes, which was a key demand of the environmental activist group Insulate Britain.",

The message from leading climate scientists is clear: action is needed now. Not tomorrow, not next year, not by the end of the decade.Even drastic carbon reduction today that limits temperature increases to the 1.5C agreed in Paris will alter the world we live in for ever. The IPCC concludes that every fraction of a degree more will edge us towards tipping points that will leave deep scars on our planet.While much has been said about the damage to weather patterns, crop yields and coral reefs, less well understood is the effect a hotter world has on our health. The reality is that the climate crisis is the biggest health crisis of our time, bigger even than Covid-19.There has been a rise in chronic diseases linked to air pollutionHeat-related deaths are expected to treble by 2050. Currently 7 million people die prematurely each year from air pollution, more than the death toll during the entire pandemic.There has been a rise in chronic diseases linked to air pollution, and evidence suggests it is driving up cancer rates, too. Lung cancer and respiratory-related deaths linked to air pollution are up 160% over the past 30 years and it causes genetic mutations in some lung cancer-linked genes.The toll on loved ones, public health and the economy is large and rising. It has been estimated that poor health costs the global economy 15% of global GDP. It is not only oil companies, carmakers and airlines at fault. Healthcare alone contributes 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, up to 8% in advanced economies.Investing in greenhouse gas reduction is now proven beyond doubt, equalled or outweighed by the economic benefits of a healthier population, the IPCC says.Increasingly investors are focused on those companies that are taking bold and science-driven action to mitigate climate warming. While this is the right thing to do, it also makes good business sense.Decarbonising the economy is an opportunity and a driver of growth, which is why the backlash against environmental, social and governance focused investing is so misguided.",

Updrafts result in warm surface air being pushed up higher into the atmosphere. “It’s more buoyant than the cooler air and it starts to rise like a hot air balloon.”Hailstones form via a combination of updrafts, moisture in the air, and cold enough temperatures high in the atmosphere. “The stronger the updraft is, the larger hailstone that can form,” Raupach said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Wind shear – changes in horizontal wind direction or speed at different heights in the atmosphere – is also a factor. “When you have high wind shear, that causes storms to become more severe and more likely to form hail,” he added.A decrease in wind shear across Australia’s mid-north over the four decades corresponded with a reduced frequency of hail-prone days, the researchers found.Soderholm said: “In the north, there is lots of heat and humidity, but the wind shear is low, so it’s not ideal for hailstorms. In the south, we have too much wind but not enough heat and moisture. Our most frequent [hail storm] environments are around the Brisbane to Sydney region, because it’s an optimal balance.“That climatic region – we’ve seen it in the trends starting to shift farther south.",

Some people also believed burning wood must be better for the environment than using gas.But there have also been warnings that stoves cause significant air pollution, releasing fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 that has dire health implications. Politicians have called for their use to be urgently reviewed.If you have a stove and decide to remove it, you will need to pay someone to do it, unless you are experienced with DIY. When hiring someone, ensure that person is certified and insured, and it is safe for them to proceed.The person will have to extract the appliance from the chimney, then lift the stove out. A contractor may need to be found to take it away for you, but ensure they recycle it. If not, you can recycle it yourself by finding a metal recycling centre.Some stoves are suitable for conversion into gas or electric, where you can enjoy the warmth without the guilt of spreading dangerous particulates.Alternatively, if it is more for decoration than necessary heating, you could remove it entirely and use the space for something else.There are limits on where and how wood-burners are used in England. People in rural, more remote regions have leeway when it comes to burning wood in their homes, as they are less likely to add to existing pollution or affect a close neighbour. Many urban areas fall within a smoke control zone, which means it is an offence to allow smoke emissions from a chimney, unless using authorised fuel or an exempted appliance. There is also a limit on the amount of smoke that is permitted to be expelled from a chimney.Even in London, which has had smoke control areas for more than 60 years, wood-burning accounts for up to 31% of PM2.5, according to a study by King’s College.

However, research indicates that the environmental benefit is heavily dependent on the scale and type of restoration, and requires huge areas of land. One 2019 study estimated that allowing natural forests to regenerate could return 40 times as much carbon as plantations.Jesús Aguirre-Gutiérrez, an ecologist at the University of Oxford who led the paper, said the scientists decided to say something after witnessing the increase in commercial plantations in the tropics.‘Tree-planting should not be seen as an alternative to rapidly cutting fossil fuel emissions,’ said Simon Lewis from University College London.

They include €1.4bn of funds from the environment ministry to tackle the drought and increase the availability of water, and €784m from the agriculture ministry to help farmers maintain production and avoid food shortages.The plan came a day after the Socialist-led coalition government announced legislation that will mean outdoor workers such as refuse collectors, street sweepers and builders will not have to work when the Spanish meteorological office issues high temperature alerts. The move follows the deaths of a street sweeper and a leaflet delivery man during last July’s heatwave in the Madrid region.Spain’s environment minister, Teresa Ribera, said her department would spend €1.4bn on building new infrastructure such as desalination plants; on doubling the proportion of water that is reused in urban areas from 10% to 20% by 2027; and on subsidising those whose irrigation water supplies would be reduced.She said: “Spain is a country that is used to periods of drought but there’s no doubt that, as a consequence of the climate change we’re experiencing, we’re seeing far more frequent and intense events and phenomena.“And we need to prepare for that by taking advantage of all the technical capacity that Spain has accrued and developed over many years. We need to deal with episodes such as the present one – and that requires planning, structural measures and also, obviously, short-term and immediate help plans.”Ribera said promising more water was not the answer, stressing that investments had to be made to manage demand and drive efficient use of the resource.The agriculture minister, Luis Planas, said most of the €784m promised by his ministry would go on direct help to livestock and grain farmers, who would also receive tax breaks.",

An OECD report from 2022 said water availability in Gotland was expected to decrease by 13% between 2021 and 2050.Following widespread enthusiasm for brown lawns in Gotland, other competitions have popped up in seven municipalities in Sweden this year, as well as three in Canada, in an effort to encourage people to use less water.A detail of Stina Östman’s winning lawn.

The heat peaked in June and September, both record hot months in a series dating back to 1884. The UK’s 10 warmest years have all occurred since 2003.Globally, 2023 is expected to have been the planet’s hottest year on record, driven by carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere that are at their highest for at least 2m years and the return of the Pacific Ocean phenomenon known as El Niño.“The observations of the UK climate are clear,” said Mike Kendon, at the Met Office. “Climate change is influencing UK temperature records over the long term, with 2023 going down as another very warm year.”“2023 also had more than its fair share of rain, with impactful storms like Babet and Ciarán influencing the figures,” he said. “Climate projections suggest an increase in the frequency of hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters. A warmer atmosphere has a greater capacity to hold moisture, so as our climate warms, we expect it to become wetter, too, and that trend is also apparent in the observations.”The average temperature in 2023 of 9.97C was marginally lower than the 10.03C recorded in 2022. The Met Office said such warm years were expected every three years in today’s heated climate.Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “The warming [in 2023] has been accompanied by sea level rise around our coasts, more intense rainfall and more deadly heatwaves, all of which are harming a growing number of lives and livelihoods in the UK. All of these impacts will go on increasing until the world reaches net zero emissions.“The UK should be leading by example in tackling the causes of climate change, particularly fossil fuels,” he said, adding that the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, “must show he understands how imperative it is to accelerate, and not slow down, the transition to net zero emissions”.",

But coffee, like many other crops, is under threat due to the climate crisis – subject to diseases, droughts and extreme weather conditions.Most of the coffee consumed worldwide comes from two species – arabica and robusta. Accounting for 70% of global coffee production, the arabica bean is more popular and for a good reason. Its smoother flavor, lower acidity and fruity hints rank paramount to robusta’s grainy, more bitter flavor. Native to Ethiopia and predominantly grown in Central and South America, arabica is the only bean that Starbucks uses in its nearly 37,000 locations worldwide. But its sensitivity to rising temperatures makes it especially vulnerable to premature ripening and crop loss.“More researchers doing work that will provide climate resilient varieties is critical,” said Sarada Krishnan, a coffee grower and scientist at the Crop Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to conserving crop diversity. Robusta, a thicker bean, is generally more favorable to heat, and therefore easier to grow. Arabica on the other hand, with its low genetic diversity, is more susceptible to diseases like coffee leaf rust – a fungus that can overtake the plant when the conditions are warmer and wetter.“When smallholder farmers get that, they lose and their whole income for the year is gone,” Krishnan, who owns an arabica coffee farm in Jamaica and knows the challenges of dealing with the disease first-hand, said. “Last year toward the end of the harvest, the rust came, and if you let the rust take over then you lose the plant and it will take five years to get a fruit crop.”Starbucks-developed arabica seeds are cultivated to resist the leaf rust and tests have been shown to generate a higher yield in a shorter period of time.",

The policies contained in the energy plan announced on Thursday are dangerous. They will significantly worsen the climate crisis that threatens to engulf us all, if the globally agreed target of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is missed. Mr Sunak’s record on green policies in the Treasury was dismal. As prime minister, he is steering the UK even further away from the course towards speedy decarbonisation that we should be on. In the long term, climate will surely top the list of public policy failures during this long period of Tory government.Hundreds of leading scientists wrote to Mr Sunak’s government this week, calling for an end to new oil and gas developments. The government is set to defy them with plans for a huge North Sea oilfield, which it attempts to justify on the grounds that it is investing £20bn (over 20 years) in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, in order to limit the damage caused. The scientists are right. The politicians and their fossil fuel industry backers are wrong. It is devastating that the UK is now trashing its own reputation for pioneering climate laws, which made national emissions reductions compulsory. Ministers have chosen risky, dirty energy over clean.There are some measures in the package that can, and must, be built on in future. Public investment in CCS would be welcome if it were not being offered as an excuse to keep on pumping oil. Technologies that remove carbon from the atmosphere could help to avoid global heating’s worst effects. Carbon border taxes are a sensible mechanism to deter high-carbon imports, and the consultation on introducing these is welcome. Stronger emphasis from the Treasury on the need for private-sector investment in the green economy is helpful, and must be translated into workable policy.But the negatives of this plan far outweigh the positives. To prioritise investment in CCS technology that doesn’t yet exist over the scaling up of renewables can only be described as reckless.",

There was still plenty of water available and nobody was buying ridiculous amounts, so there was a general feeling of: “Ha ha, we’re all going through dystopia together!”After every single bottle of water in Philadelphia had been bought and panic had escalated, the city put out an update. The gist of it was: “Whoops! Looks like you didn’t need to buy all that bottled water after all, because the tap water is fine until 11.59pm on Monday.” What might happen then? Good question.

Since the late 1970s, when the government began what has turned into a long-term land privatisation programme, about half of all public land – 2 million hectares in total, or 10% of Britain’s overall land area – has been sold, mainly to private companies.Local authority and NHS landholdings have been particularly hard hit. Today, local government owns only about 40% as much land as it did four decades ago. The NHS estate has been even more radically depleted, shrinking by around 70%. And the pace of privatisation is accelerating. Both NHS trusts and local authorities are feverishly selling off the few property assets that remain to them as they struggle to make ends meet in the face of swingeing budget cuts imposed by Whitehall.If the sell-off continues, there could be no public land left by mid-century. The NHS and many councils could be landless long before that.Does it matter if the public sector is left without land of its own? Clearly, the government thinks not.The left’s stock response to privatisation has traditionally been to contest or refute the principal logic driving it, which is that assets are utilised more efficiently in private than public hands.But this criticism misses the mark where land privatisation is concerned. Land is different. The biggest problem with land privatisation is not that the private sector is not necessarily a more efficient landowner and user. It is that when land moves from public to private ownership, some socially important land uses simply disappear. Why? The crux of the matter is what economists call market failure, a situation where the private sector fails to offer something even though there is demand for it, usually because it is not profitable for it to do so.This is what has happened as British land has been privatised. Various important demands on the land have increasingly gone unmet, because public bodies now lack the land to meet them and private-sector bodies lack the incentive.",

Its most evangelical users claim the protein can improve hair, skin, nails and joints, slowing the ageing process. As well as beauty and wellness brands, it is also used by pharmaceutical companies and those producing food ingredients.However, an investigation by the Guardian, Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Center for Climate Crime Analysis (CCCA), ITV and O Joio e O Trigo in Brazil has found cattle raised on farms causing deforestation were processed at abattoirs serving international collagen supply chains.Some of this collagen can be traced to Nestlé-owned Vital Proteins, a leading producer of bovine collagen supplements. Vital Proteins’ collagen range is sold globally, including in the US and UK.Jennifer Aniston, the actor and chief creative officer of Vital Proteins, has called collagen “the glue that holds everything together”. She claims to have been using it for years, adding it to her morning coffee.While there are studies suggesting taking collagen orally can improve joint and skin health, Harvard School of Public Health cautions potential conflicts of interest exist as most if not all of the research is either funded by the industry or carried out by scientists affiliated with it.Collagen companies have no obligation to track its environmental impacts. Unlike beef, soya, palm oil and other food commodities, collagen is also not covered by forthcoming due diligence legislation in the EU and UK designed to tackle deforestation.Nestlé said that the allegations raised are not in line with its commitment to responsible sourcing and that it has contacted its supplier to investigate. It added that it is taking steps to “ensure its products are deforestation-free by 2025”.What is collagen and why is it so popular in the beauty industry?",

If the reservoir dries up, this water supply will be reduced.Map showing canal system branching out from the Kakhovka reservoirThe most significant of these canals are the North Crimean and Kakhovsky canals, which run from just north of the broken dam.The North Crimean canal supplies water to western Kherson before flowing down to Crimea. Its entrance is just before the dam and satellite imagery from 6 June already shows increased greenery within its reservoir – a sign of the water level decreasing.Slider image showing destruction of the Nova Kakhovka damThe Kakhovsky canal irrigates most of the Kherson region’s fields before entering Zaporizhzhia.Dnipro region is also supported by the Dnipro-Kryvyi Rih canal which runs north of the Kakhovka reservoir, while a separate canal system provides drinking water and irrigation to the city of Zaporizhzhia.Satellite imagery of the area directly south of the reservoir, around these canals, shows mile upon mile of agricultural land. The circular formations are caused by a centre-pivot irrigation system that waters crops with equipment that rotates around a pivot.Satellite imagery of crop fields south of Kakhovka reservoirUkraine’s most important crops are corn, wheat, sunflower seed and barley. All of these yields are already down by at least a fifth in 2023-24, according to the US Department of Agriculture.There are fears that declining levels in the Kakhovka reservoir will mean less water feeding through to the network of canals used to irrigate these crops.With the exception of corn, which has its biggest yields in northern Ukraine, the other three crops are centred in the south.Small multiple maps showing each Ukrainian region’s crop productionDnipro and Zaporizhzhia are some of the most important regions for wheat and both rely on canals that run from the reservoir.",

A council consultation found respondents overwhelmingly objected to it. More than 16,000 people signed a petition against the work.On Friday activists got an existing injunction against more trees being cut down extended. They have accused the council of trying to avoid scrutiny of the works.Perritt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it would bring benefits. “Change is difficult,” he said. “We are really anxious to work with people who are unhappy with what we’re doing and make sure we deliver a fabulous result for the city centre. [It] will be really good for Plymouth in the short and medium term.”The trees were removed shortly after the Conservative leader of Plymouth council, Richard Bingley, had signed an executive decision to cut them down for the £12m scheme. Council workers shut off the site, chopping down the trees under the cover of darkness. Campaigners then hastily obtained an injunction to stop further felling.Bingley said he planned to step down on Monday as leader of the Conservative group and head of the authority. He told the Plymouth Herald: “I’ve always said I’m not a full-time politician, I don’t seek to be. I’m just an individual who is passionate and ambitious for Plymouth. If others feel they can run our glorious Ocean City better, then that’s great with me. Over to you, I say.”Bingley faced a no confidence vote over the trees.The row mirrors disputes over trees in other cities across the UK. The leader of Sheffield city council was criticised in an independent review earlier in March over thousands of street trees being cut down between 2013 and 2018, which led to protests.",

He became chair of the committee after his predecessor, Neil Parish, resigned after a pornography scandal.However, Goodwill has recently become the chairman of a new rightwing pressure group called Conservative Friends of the Countryside. The group is calling for a range of policies including halting the release of beavers; continuing the burning of peatland; continuing the use of bee-killing neonicotinoid pesticides; and stopping a ban on imports of hunting trophies from endangered animals.Since Boris Johnson stepped down as prime minister, the government has pulled back on a number of nature commitments, including beaver releases and an end to the badger cull, after pressure from backbench MPs. A new ban on the burning of vegetation on deep peat, one of the UK’s most vital carbon sinks, has been criticised by campaigners for including too many loopholes after landowners and backbenchers lobbied for it to be watered down.Members of the Conservative Friends of the Countryside group include Sir Bill Wiggin, MP for North Herefordshire, who has spoken against bans on foxhunting, referring to it as “class war”; and Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, MP for the Cotswolds and an outspoken shooting campaigner who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on shooting and conservation.Also on the committee are rural PR guru Amanda Anderson, who has long campaigned against a ban on peatland burning; and George Bowyer, who used to run the Fitzwilliam Hunt and chair of a group called Vote-OK, which campaigned for an end to the ban on foxhunting.Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, called for Goodwill to resign from either the group or the committee.She told the Guardian: “This group is less like friends of the countryside and more like friends of the hunting, shooting and landowning elites. Its destructive and dangerous list of policies will poison agriculture, threaten animal protection and pollute our planet.",

It makes up 60% of our cartilage and accounts for 70 to 80% of the dry weight of skin, also featuring in other connective tissues such as tendons, muscles and bones.It gives our bodies elasticity and resilience, but its production slows down as we age, leading to more aches and pains and making us look older and more wrinkly. Factors such as sun exposure and smoking, along with chronic stress, lack of sleep or exercise, can speed its decline.The desire to mitigate these ageing effects has contributed to a global industry estimated to be worth $4bn (£3.32bn) in 2022. There are 28 different types of collagen, and collagen products range from texture-enhancing food additives and meat casings to health supplements and beauty products.Collagen can be sourced from pigs, chicken and fish – but collagen from cows makes up 34% of the market. Grand View Research attributes this to “the high availability of cattle and lower prices”.For anyone lamenting the loss of suppleness in their skin, a nicely packaged cream loaded with collagen might seem worth a try, but it’s unlikely the ingredient will be effective in this form.Topical collagen would need to penetrate deep beneath the skin’s surface to be useful, but its fibres are too large to get through the outer layer. Despite the science, however, it remains a popular product at beauty counters, with all the big brands including it in their ranges.Collagen types I, II and III are the most important in skin and musculoskeletal health. They can be found in a rapidly expanding range of oral supplements, usually in capsules or as loose powder, in forms that are broken down and easy to digest, known as “hydrolised collagen” or “collagen peptides”.US actor Jennifer Aniston, who calls collagen “the glue that holds everything together”, is chief creative officer of Vital Proteins, a brand whose collagen powder she says she has been using for years.

Cambridge city council’s planning officer argued that the PV panels – with the potential to generate 123,000kWh of electricity a year – would erode the “authenticity and integrity” of this “historically iconic medieval building”.And King’s, nearly 600 years old but usually regarded as the radical provocateur among Cambridge colleges, was criticised in the Spectator for “virtue signalling” over the panels, which will meet all the chapel’s power needs but provide just 5.5% of the college’s overall electricity requirements.However, the college provost and dean were beaming on a rooftop tour of the ongoing installation on Tuesday.“It’s not so much signalling virtue as signalling a clarion call for change,” said Gillian Tett, a Financial Times columnist and the new provost of King’s. “We face a climate emergency. We have to be imaginative about how we respond to it. Yes, it’s a symbol but symbols reinforce what’s normal and we’re trying to change what’s thought of as normal.”Gillian Tett said: ‘People don’t come to King’s College chapel to see the roof.’ Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe Rev Dr Stephen Cherry, dean of the college, said he thought the solar panels humanised the building. “It’s our own local powerhouse,” he said.Cherry admitted he was surprised when the college was permitted to fit the solar array. Councillors sitting on the city’s planning committee only voted unanimously in favour of the panels – against their planning officer’s advice – after a barnstorming appeal by former provost and astrophysicist Michael Proctor.Striding the scaffold boards across the apex of the roof, Cherry said: “It was a surprise really because it’s so difficult to know how people are going to balance the aesthetic against the practical.

It also determines how much heat and carbon dioxide the oceans store.Melting Antarctic ice predicted to cause rapid slowdown of deep ocean current by 2050Read moreScientists warn that its slowdown could have drastic impacts, including increasing sea levels, altering weather patterns and depriving marine ecosystems of vital nutrients.“Changes in the overturning circulation are a big deal,” said the study’s co-author, Dr Steve Rintoul, an oceanographer and expert on the Southern Ocean at the Australian government’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).The climate crisis: A three-week masterclass with academics, journalists and activistsRead more“It’s something that is a concern because it touches on so many aspects of the Earth, including climate, sea level, and marine life.”The finding comes months after modelling, which Rintoul was involved in, that predicted a 40% slowdown in the circulation by 2050.“The model projections of rapid change in the deep ocean circulation in response to melting of Antarctic ice might, if anything, have been conservative,” Rintoul said. “We’re seeing changes have already happened in the ocean that were not projected to happen until a few decades from now.”The overturning circulation originates in the cold and dense waters that plunge down deep off Antarctica’s continental shelf and spread to ocean basins globally. It brings oxygen to the deep ocean and returns nutrients to the surface ocean.“What’s driven the slowing is the fact that that dense shelf water is not as dense as it used to be because it’s not as salty as it used to be,” Rintoul said.The melting of Antarctic glacial ice, the researchers found, has resulted in additional freshwater, increasing buoyancy.The study looked specifically at changes in overturning circulation in the Australian Antarctic basin, but the researchers believe a “circumpolar slowdown” is occurring.",

Freddy is forecast to inflict much more damage.Estimates suggest winds are reaching 140mph, comfortably within category 4 cyclone intensity, or Very Intense Tropical Cyclone status. Despite forecasts of a slight reduction in intensity over the coming days, by the time Freddy makes landfall in Madagascar, gusts are likely to be about 100mph, making it a category 2 cyclone. With destructive winds and significant rainfall of 100-200mm possible, there will also be a severe risk of deadly landslides.Freddy has had a long journey across the Indian Ocean over the past few weeks, having developed into a category 1 cyclone on 6 February, just south of Indonesia. Since then it has travelled almost 4,000 miles across the ocean over the past 14 days to where it is now, about 1,000 miles off the east coast of Madagascar.Only two other cyclones are known to have crossed the Indian Ocean: Eline and Hudah, both in 2000. Despite Freddy seeming like a significantly long-lasting cyclone that will have travelled the span of an ocean, it is a long way off from the farthest travelled and longest-lasting.In 1994, Hurricane John, also known as Typhoon John, tracked more than 7,000 miles in 31 days. The hurricane started off in the eastern Pacific and reached so far west that it was also considered a typhoon because it existed in the east and west basins of the Pacific Ocean.Once Freddy makes landfall, its interaction with the elevation of the land and reduction in a moisture source will make it weaken fairly quickly, with winds reducing to about 50mph by the time the cyclone clears the western side of Madagascar.",

But in a summary ruling, Amsterdam district court said protests could continue around the ship, although it ruled that Greenpeace’s climbers had to come down or the organisation would face fines of €50,000 a day.Both sides have claimed victory in the case. Greenpeace called the ruling “a massive setback for the deep sea mining industry”. It also lashed out at The Metals Company, claiming it “has never been interested in scrutiny and they can’t stand that Greenpeace is watching and opposing them at every turn”.",

And understandably so: perfectly roasted chicken on top of a bed of dressed salad and croutons soaked in chicken dripping. In my low-waste version, I make the dressing mainly from the chicken fat and without olive oil, and roast the bird on top of the bread, so it absorbs as much flavour as possible.A low-waste version of Zuni Cafe’s roast chicken and bread saladThis dish is a lesson in Californian simplicity. By seasoning the chicken two to three days in advance and keeping it in the fridge uncovered, you more or less air-dry the bird, making the meat more flavourful and the skin crisper. Inspired by Victoria Glass, who makes salad dressing from the fat rendered from roast meat, I’ve adapted Zuni Cafe’s recipe by making my dressing mostly with the chicken dripping, rather than olive oil.If need be, ask a butcher to spatchcock the chicken for you; they may even salt it for you, if you don’t fancy air-curing the bird in your fridge. When storing chicken uncovered in your fridge, of course be extra careful that it doesn’t come into contact with any other foods, to avoid cross-contamination.Serves 61 small chicken (about 1½kg), spatchcocked Sea salt and black pepper300g stale bread3 tbsp olive oil35g pine nuts4 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced1 garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced35g currants or raisins45ml white- or red-wine vinegar80g mixed salad leaves, ideally some of them bitter – I used baby spinach and radicchioUsing your fingertips, loosen the skin from the breast and thighs of the chicken, generously season the bird all over with sea salt, including under the skin, then put in the fridge uncovered for 48-72 hours.Take the chicken out of the fridge two hours before you want to cook it. Heat the oven to its highest setting – 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9 or higher. Tear the bread into large cubes, put these in an ovenproof frying pan with two tablespoons of olive oil, and toss to coat.

It has been driven to the edge of extinction due to entanglement in fishing nets known as “gillnets”, which are now illegal in the area.The scientific committee of the IWC said in a statement it had grave concerns over the survival of the vaquita and had issued the alert to highlight the actions needed to save it. It said extinction of the porpoise was inevitable unless all gillnets were replaced with alternative fishing gear that protected it and the livelihoods of fishers.“If this doesn’t happen now, it will be too late,” it said.Dr Lindsay Porter, the vice-chair of the IWC’s scientific committee said: “We wanted, with the extinction alert, to send the message to a wider audience and for everyone to understand how serious this is.”The porpoises, which measure about 1.2-1.5 metres, become entangled and die in gillnets, which are flat fishing nets suspended vertically in the water. These nets are used by poachers to hunt the totoaba, an endangered fish prized for its swim bladder in Chinese medicine and sold at vast profits on the black market in China and Hong Kong. During the rise in the totoaba trade, the vaquita’s population has plummeted from 567 to 10 over the last decade.In 2022, the Mexican navy, in collaboration with government agencies, placed concrete blocks in an area known as the zero tolerance area, and increased enforcement to deter illegal gillnet fishing and protect the vaquita. There is some evidence illegal fishing has moved to the edge of the zone, creating new problem areas.The committee, made up of 200 leading scientists, said the effect of the deterrent structures looked promising but needed monitoring. The involvement of organised crime in the totoaba fishery and problems with enforcing fishing regulations at sea made it difficult to address, it said.",

That 22bn tonnes that must be eliminated is equivalent to the combined emissions of the top five polluters today: China, US, India, Russia and Japan.Furthermore, the systemic transformation of every aspect of society that the report says is required needs to start kicking in quickly enough to halt the relentless rise of emissions seen since the Industrial Revolution within just two years.The global stocktake is the most comprehensive analysis of global climate action produced to date and is based on scientific and technical data, as well as consultations with governments, business and civil society. It is a key document that sets out what is required when leaders meet at the UN climate summit Cop28 in November.The report notes that the 2015 Paris agreement has driven action but says “much more is needed now on all fronts”. Crucially, it says it can be done. “There are now sufficient cost-effective opportunities to address the 2030 emissions gap,” it says.The “indispensable” actions required are “scaling up renewable energy and phasing out all unabated fossil fuels”, as well as ending the destruction of forests and reducing methane emissions, especially from oil and gas operations.The report does not shy away from the scale of the challenge. “It is essential to unlock and redeploy trillions of dollars to meet global investment needs,” it says. In other words, it requires reengineering the global financial system. Stopping the fossil fuel investments and vast subsidies that are throwing fuel on the climate fire is critical, it says.The report acknowledges that “rapid change can be disruptive” but says ensuring climate policies are fair and protect the poor helps to extinguish opposition. Climate policies can also be poverty eradication policies, it says, such as replacing expensive gas power with cheap renewables.",

Of the capital’s 2.6m registered vehicles, which belong to around half of all households, it is thought that around one in five do not meet the new test. But given that car ownership is higher in the outer boroughs than in the affected area, some drivers of more polluting cars will neither be forced to pay the £12.50 daily charge nor change their vehicles.Within the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) it is a different story. Most petrol cars registered after 2005 meet the tougher standard; most diesel ones registered before 2015 don’t. Owners of such vehicles have some cause to feel aggrieved. Driving is not inherently antisocial and has been powerfully incentivised for decades, with cheating manufacturers to blame for a false consensus that developed around diesel’s supposedly greener credentials. For families or other groups, driving is too often the cheapest and quickest way to travel – due in part to excessive rail and other transport costs. For some people, in some circumstances, there is no other way to get around.But given the knowledge about the effects of air pollution on human health, including some evidence linking it to more severe coronavirus infections, the Ulez can only be welcomed. Under the former mayor Boris Johnson, London’s air stayed filthy in spite of a growing body of research showing pollution’s damaging effects. One study last year found that London was the worst city in Europe for health costs associated with air pollution, while a coroner ruled that it contributed to the death of a nine-year-old girl, Ella Kissi-Debrah, from asthma in 2013.The problem is not limited to the capital, although as the UK’s largest city by a huge margin, it attracts the most headlines. Between 2015 and 2018, the government was defeated three times in court by the environmental campaigner ClientEarth over illegal pollution levels across the country. While Bath and Birmingham are due to introduce similar low-emission schemes, other cities have put plans on hold.",

It also asks investors to support all climate-linked shareholder resolutions, particularly those that call for an end to new fossil fuel projects.A spokesperson for the University of Sussex said: “Our academics have identified new fossil fuel projects as a key threat to meeting critical global climate targets, including limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees. Asset managers, who hold trillions in investments on behalf of their clients, have a key role to play in stewarding the world’s economy away from fossil fuels.”The latest call for a revolt against the fossil fuel industry has emerged as Shell braces for what is expected to be one of its most hostile annual meetings in London after fierce climate protests in recent weeks that have disrupted the AGMs held by BP, Barclays and Drax.Leading investment funds, proxy advisers and activist shareholders are preparing to take Shell to task for failing to outline a business strategy that aligns with the Paris climate agreement.The company’s chair, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, will face calls to be ousted from the board by the Church of England Pensions Board, Britain’s Local Authorities Pension Funds Forum and the UK’s biggest workplace pensions manager, Nest.Shareholder advisers at PIRC and USS have also recommended that shareholders vote against the reappointment of Mackenzie, or other board members, to protest against what they view as insufficient progress on the energy transition.",

Catherine David, Wrap’s director of behaviour change and business programmes, said the progress made by 130 brands and retailers involved showed “it’s possible to change this”. But that at the moment, “as fast as positive improvements happen, they’re cancelled out by rising production”.The companies had reduced the carbon impact of their textiles by 12% and water by 4% (on a per-tonne basis) between 2019 and 2022. However, this was negated by a 13% increase in the volume of textiles produced and sold, according to the report. The increased production rates meant overall water use actually rose by 8% over the period, while the carbon reduction figure stood at just 2%.Since production is obviously related to consumption, David said consumers had a part to play. “We’re working with companies to improve clothes, but the other part of the equation is our role as shoppers,” she said. “We buy more clothes than any other nation in Europe.“Our research shows that a quarter of most wardrobes go unworn in a year and nearly a quarter of us admit to wearing clothes only a few times,” she continued. “Moving into winter is the perfect time to look through our wardrobes – wear what we have and consider whether it’s time to let something go. You can donate, sell or give clothes away – it all helps them move around the economy and reduce the amount produced.”Wrap wants businesses to design clothes for a longer life, with good durability and recyclability and more recycled content.",

It spent £232m on distributing dividends and paying interest on its debts in the two years to March 2022, according to a research by the University of Greenwich, compared with investments of £179.8m in upgrading infrastructure – from replacing pipes to improving water supplies.The company, which serves customers in Kent, Sussex, Berkshire and Surrey, came under fire over the summer when 6,000 households were left without running water for up to a week.

A state of emergency was introduced in Kurgan province, where more than 5,000 buildings have burned down.

It is courage and leadership that we need now,” they said.“In the past, we have mobilised many of our members collectively with extraordinary results, and our resolve to stand firm now against any and all attacks on this critical policy agenda remains absolute.”Their warning comes after the Conservative party narrowly succeeded in holding on to the safe Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat in the byelection triggered by the former prime minister Boris Johnson’s departure from the Commons.The constituency’s Conservative candidate, Steve Tuckwell, centred his campaign on opposition to the planned expansion of London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which is designed to reduce vehicle pollution in the capital, but which has also become a rallying point for opponents of the Labour London mayor, Sadiq Khan.The result led some to suggest that there was political capital to be made for Tories concerned about the party’s disastrous polling in exploiting so-called local wedge issues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The needs of developing countries are likely to reach hundreds of billions a year, and this is unlikely to be met only from the public purses of developed countries, so most countries agree that new sources of funding must be found.An airline levy is one of the frontrunners, but Mitchell indicated it could struggle to gain support from the British government. He told the Guardian at Cop28 that this was not an official position but his own view. However, Rishi Sunak has previously acted to reduce air passenger duty in the UK, so it would be little surprise if he vetoed other levies on flying.The frequent flyer levy was proposed last year by the V20 group of the world’s most vulnerable countries, and has broad support among many developed and developing countries. Eamon Ryan, the Irish environment minister who is charged with examining innovative sources of finance for the EU, said: “There are various principles behind it that make sense: ‘polluter pays’ is a basic principle, and there’s equity to it. It’s the wealthier people in the world who fly.”He said the tax need not be large: a small levy on each of the hundreds of millions of international flight tickets sold each year would raise billions, and the EU was already looking at the issue of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. “It doesn’t have to be punitive,” he told the Guardian in a separate interview at the climate conference.Other innovative sources of finance under consideration include a possible carbon levy on shipping. Steps have already been taken at the International Maritime Organization to put this into practice, after a softening this year of previously strong opposition from the shipping industry and some countries with large fleets.",

The severe heat and prolonged nature of this heat – ocean temperatures are likely to remain elevated for another month – has placed Florida’s corals, particularly around the Florida Keys region, at severe risk.“The temperatures have clearly been higher than anything ever recorded before,” said Derek Manzello, coordinator of Noaa’s coral reef watch program. “You hear the word ‘unprecedented’ get thrown around a lot but Florida’s corals have never been exposed to this level of heat stress before.“The big concern here is that the Florida Keys corals will experience a mass mortality and that will push the reef ecosystem towards a trajectory of degradation, with severe ramifications in terms of the ecological services it provides.”Florida’s reefs are some of the most visited in the world by scuba divers and, as a treasure trove of marine life, a prized site for species such as spiny lobsters, snappers and stone crabs favored by fishers. But the corals have suffered deterioration over the past 50 years due to pollution and, increasingly, bleaching events due to the rising ocean temperatures caused by the burning of fossil fuels – there have been eight bleaching events since 1987.Scientists estimate that about 70% of Florida’s reefs are losing material, with this erosion hastened by bleaching, which occurs during periods of spiking heat. When it gets too hot, algae leave the tissue of corals, leaving them white, or bleached, in color. If this persists, the coral is vulnerable to disease and can die.",

For Guoliang Liu, an associate professor of chemistry at Virginia Tech and author of the paper published in the journal Science, this similarity suggested it should be possible to convert polyethylene into fatty acids, and then into soap. The problem was size: molecularly, plastics are very large, about 3,000 carbon atoms long, whereas fatty acids are much smaller.The solution came to Liu in an unusual way. “It was Christmas. I was watching the fireplace,” he said.When firewood burns, it gives off smoke, which is made up of smaller particles of the firewood. Liu wondered whether burning plastic would work the same way.“Firewood is mostly made of polymers such as cellulose. The combustion of firewood breaks these polymers into short chains, and then into small gaseous molecules before full oxidation to carbon dioxide,” he said. “If we similarly break down the synthetic polyethylene molecules but stop the process before they break all the way down to small gaseous molecules, then we should obtain short-chain, polyethylene-like molecules.”Liu and colleagues built an oven-like reactor that could be used to safely burn plastic. The temperature at the bottom was hot enough to break up the polymer chains, while the top was cooled low enough to stop them breaking down too far.The scientists collected the residue and found the product they had created was short-chain polyethylene, a type of wax. They then went on to turn the wax into soap.“It’s the first soap ever made from plastic in the world,” Liu said. “It has a bit of a unique colour. But it works.”Liu’s method works on polyethylene and polypropylene, which are the two most common types of plastic. Together, they make up about half of all plastic waste: close to 200m tonnes every year.",

You wield incredible power. It’s long overdue you meet your responsibilities and bear down on the attempts to distort truth.”The mayor said there was evidence that “hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on the anti-Ulez online manipulation campaign on Twitter alone” but “we have no idea who was behind the campaign”.Research conducted by the social media analysts Valent in July concluded there was evidence of “an extensive online campaign targeted to undermine support for the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez)” before the Uxbridge byelection.It found that 48% of the accounts on Twitter, now known as X, mentioning Ulez were created after November 2022, and of those about 90% “exhibited signs of inauthenticity”, using generic names and with a high proportion of fake followers.These accounts – called spreaders – were primarily engaged in retweeting anti-Ulez opinions from real people or groups opposed to expansion of the area covered by the £12.50 daily charge for old, polluting vehicles across all of London in August.The aim, the researchers concluded, was to have “thousands of accounts promoting anti-Ulez content on to users’ timelines”. Valent said it only looked at anti-Ulez accounts on Twitter, not other social media sites, but it believed the campaign cost at least £168,000.Labour failed to take Boris Johnson’s old seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in July by 495 votes, despite big swings against the Conservatives in two other English seats the same day.

A number of food retailers, including Co-op and Morrisons, pulled the 10p bags from their stores in 2021 after learning that most ended up in the bin, with the average household getting through 50 a year.Some more expensive bags are made from a mixture of materials, such as hemp and plastic, which are difficult to recycle.“We can do it better,” Hindmarch, whose designs are favoured by The Princess of Wales and is a friend of Samantha Cameron, said. “There are something like 8bn tonnes of plastic on the planet and that is really shocking when you think about it.“You have got to keep pushing and talking about it.

He has also adopted 60 more as part of an effort to study the effect that grazing has on managing grass, brush and other fuel for wildfires in the face of increasingly extreme blazes.“I started watching the horses and seeing what they were doing,” says Simpson. “They were managing the fuel.”He calls the project the Wild Horse Fire Brigade, and hopes the discoveries he makes from living among the animals will contribute to the debate around the role herbivores can play in wildfire mitigation. Wild horses roam Simpson’s land near the Oregon-California border Simpson socialises with his herd every day and has formed a strong bond with them. The stones (right) mark the spot where he buried one of them, Ariel, on a hilltop near his home Simpson argues that the steep decline of herbivores in the region – the deer population in California has shrunk to less than 500,000 from an estimated peak of about 2m in 1960 – is a factor in the state’s overgrown forests and grasslands, which in turn feeds increasingly extreme wildfires.“We’ve lost our herbivory so now we have abundant, abnormally high levels of vegetative materials – that is what’s driving the fires,” says Simpson. Simpson says a wild horse will consume about 13kg (30lb) of grass and brush a day, which helps keep potential wildfires at bay Federal protection was granted to wild horses and burros in 1971 in an effort to stop their decline. This quickly led to a population surge and a few years later the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which has jurisdiction over most wild horse lands, was tasked with mitigating the rapid growth. The agency began removing wild horses from public lands in annual round-ups. Last year, 20,000 horses were removed from public lands. Nearly 8,000 of those were adopted or sold, and 1,622 were given fertility treatment. A drone is used to monitor the location of the horses.",

During the current year, prices will average $19.90/GJ.While volumes were basically steady, rising only 6% in the 2021-22 year to 82.2m tonnes, their total value soared 130% to about $70.2bn.

Even raking back $20bn of that boon would fund the government’s entire Rewiring the Nation plan to modernise the grid.“A wide and growing range of experts back a windfall profits tax as an economically responsible way for Australians to receive a fair return for the once-off exploitation of our gas resources,” said Richard Denniss, executive director at the Australia Institute.“Many LNG companies pay little if any income tax and get much of the gas for free as it’s not subject to royalties.“LNG producers in Australia are overwhelmingly foreign-owned, with profits flowing almost entirely overseas.”Pressure from industry groups has been mounting on the Albanese government to do more to lower high energy costs, particularly in eastern Australian states. Last month’s deal to secure sufficient gas to avoid supply gaps may only serve to lock in high prices, the groups – from aluminium smelters to food manufacturers – have said.Western Australia, which has had a reservation policy keeping 15% of LNG exporters’ supplies for domestic users since 2006, is paying only about $5/gigajoule for gas, state energy minister Bill Johnston told Guardian Australia last week.",

The colonies prey on invertebrates, larger vertebrates and plants, destroying native plants and out-competing native ants, insects and herbivores for food.The red fire ant is the fifth most costly invasive species in the world, spreading via human trade from its native South America into Mexico, the Caribbean, Australia and the US, where it causes an estimated damage of $6bn (£4.8bn) each year.Researchers have identified 88 red fire ant nests across 5 hectares (12 acres) near the city of Syracuse, in Sicily, Italy. According to genetic analyses in a study published in Current Biology, the invasive colonies could have come from China or the US.Roger Vila, the principal investigator at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology’s Butterfly Diversity and Evolution Lab, who led the study, said: “Coordinated efforts for early detection and rapid response in the region are essential to successfully manage this new threat, before it spreads uncontrollably.”The charity Buglife said invasive ant species were easily spread when plants in soil are imported into Britain and called on the government to ban the import of soil.The EU has banned the export of soil from the UK but the UK has not taken reciprocal measures to stop imports , mostly via the horticultural trade.David Smith, of Buglife, said: “It’s an open door for non-native species that are soil-dwellers. There’s widespread concern about these non-native invasive ant species of which this is one of a handful which are on the cusp of making it into Europe.“We can do something to stop these arriving but once an invasive ant species is here it’s going to be very hard to eradicate.

However, two problems are increasingly threatening sweet chestnuts: the oriental chestnut gall wasp (OCGW) and a fungus, chestnut blight.The OCGW lays its eggs inside a tree’s buds, which causes galls – abnormal growths – to appear, and reduces its ability to produce nuts. The fungal disease chestnut blight can eventually kill a tree, causing cankers on its bark. Both are quickly spreading across Europe.Government officials and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) have launched a campaign to teach people how to recognise a sweet chestnut and report signs of the pest and the disease.Clues to look out for include distorted leaves or buds with swellings (galls), a sparse crown and sunken, cracking or discoloured bark.The findings will help Forest Research scientists, who are undertaking a study into the country’s sweet chestnuts, to find the problem areas.

We’ve got a big boat out there, which has five of the enormous wind turbines on it and that’s circling around looking to start the installation. Hopefully we’ll see first power from this windfarm over the next week or so.”Phillips-Davies said that future windfarms would require the government’s subsidies to keep pace with the rising costs of materials and services as a result of significant inflation in the UK economy.“Government needs to put in place the flexibility to ensure that we can still build these windfarms,” he said. “We’ve got to remember that the price of power from [windfarms] is still way lower than what we see coming from imported fuels, and gas in particular.”Last month the government’s green energy ambitions were dealt a blow after plans for a giant offshore windfarm off the Norfolk coast ground to a halt due to increasing supply chain costs and rising interest rates.The Swedish energy firm Vattenfall said it would stop work on the multibillion-pound Norfolk Boreas windfarm, designed to power the equivalent of 1.5m British homes, because it was no longer profitable.In response the government agreed to increase the subsidy pot to support new renewable energy projects by £22m to take the total budget to £227m for the next auction for subsidy contracts.",

Now research suggests that today’s home run hitters are seeing their shots turbocharged by the climate crisis.A study by researchers at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire used data from 100,000 Major League Baseball games and 220,000 individually hit balls to show that higher temperatures increase the number of balls hit out of the park.They found that between 2010 and 2019, global heating led on average to an extra 58 home runs a year. Since 6,776 home runs were hit in the record-setting 2019 season, the effect is modest. But each degree Celsius of future warming is associated with about 95 more home runs a season, they said. If the climate crisis was not mitigated, rising temperatures could be responsible for a 10% increase by the end of the century.“When you have warmer temperatures you have lower air density, and when you have lower air density you have less drag on a flying object, whether that’s a baseball or an aeroplane,” said Justin Mankin, an assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth and senior author of the study published by the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. “On a warm day as opposed to a cool day you should expect more home runs.”The authors accounted for a number of other influences, including covered stadiums, manufacturing variabilities in bats and balls, use of performance-enhancing drugs and the effect of modern sports analytics. They found the biggest home run surge was liable to take place at Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, because it hosts a large number of daytime games, meaning hotter temperatures than at night.Though the Texas Rangers’ previous ballpark opened as recently as 1994, the summer heat in the Dallas region proved so uncomfortable that the club moved to a climate-controlled $1.2bn new stadium with a retractable roof in 2020. Among the league’s 30 stadiums, eight have retractable or fixed roofs.“More roofs on ballparks is going to be unavoidable. That is frustrating,” said Christopher Callahan, the lead author of the study. “One of the joys of baseball is sitting in the open air, sitting under the blue sky and the breeze.",

This means emissions from food alone, ignoring the huge impact of fossil fuels, would push the world past the 1.5C limit.Methane emissions from 15 meat and dairy companies rival those of the EURead moreThe study showed that 75% of this food-related heating was driven by foods that are high sources of methane, ie those coming from ruminant livestock such as cattle, and rice paddy fields. However, the scientists said the temperature rise could be cut by 55% by cutting meat consumption in rich countries to medically recommended levels, reducing emissions from livestock and their manure, and using renewable energy in the food system.Previous studies have shown the huge impact of food production on the environment, particularly meat and dairy, but the new study provides estimates of the temperature rises their emissions could cause. These could be a significant underestimate, however, as the study assumed animal product consumption would remain level in the future but it was projected to rise by 70% by 2050.“Methane has this really dominant role in driving the warming associated with the food systems,” said Catherine Ivanovich, at Columbia University in the US, who led the research. “Sustaining the pattern [of food production] we have today is not consistent with keeping the 1.5C temperature threshold. That places a lot of urgency on reducing the emissions, especially from the high-methane food groups.”“We have to make the goal of sustaining our global population consistent with a climate-safe future,” she said.The contribution of global food production to the climate crisis is complex because it involves several important greenhouse gases, all of which have different abilities to trap heat and persist in the atmosphere for different amounts of time.",

A young crew of protesters, each individually getting a backstory flashback which sometimes jumps into the drama at a cliffhanger moment, come together for the big job, knowing each other as little as Tarantino’s colour-coded bad guys and having similar issues around gunshot wound injury and possible disloyalty.Director and co-screenwriter Daniel Goldhaber applies a fictional imagination to the first two words in the title of Malm’s book, which argues for direct-action property destruction but is not actually a “how to” bomb-making guide like William Powell’s 1971 gonzo classic The Anarchist Cookbook; it is still in print and still assuredly being studied by climate activists. Goldhaber’s drama shows how this kind of paramilitary adventure might actually happen, month by month, moment by moment, as well as the kind of people who would be sufficiently motivated or reckless to risk decades in federal prison. They are all drawn together by a plan to blow up a west Texas oil pipeline, disrupt the flow and drive its price ruinously up.Interestingly, there is no clear leader, no one whose job is to explain to the gang (and the audience) what is going to happen, in scenes which would involve them standing in front of a whiteboard or a table with toy cars around a cardboard model. In so far as someone is in charge, it appears to be Michael (Forrest Goodluck), a bomb specialist: although the lightbulb moment of having the idea and finding the exact spot where a bomb could be planted are relatively unimportant and almost invisible.Michael is a young Native American who resents the oil rigs destroying his homeland; Xochitl (Ariela Barer) and Theo (Sasha Lane, from Andrea Arnold’s American Honey) are friends affected by big oil’s toxic pollution in their neighbourhood, and Theo’s girlfriend Alisha (Jayme Lawson) agrees to help.",

A Scottish government source said they hoped an incoming Labour government might decide to reinstate glass after the next general election.Scottish ministers had wanted their scheme to begin in March 2024. But under the UK’s post-Brexit internal market rules, designed to minimise trade barriers within the UK, they needed permission from Westminster to introduce a mandatory deposit and different barcodes.Campaigners who support deposit return schemes, widely used in other European countries, said excluding glass on cost grounds will substantially reduce the amount of glass being recycled and increase carbon emissions.They said the delay would mean millions of plastic and glass bottles and aluminium cans would now litter Scottish streets, fields and beaches.Dr Kat Jones, the director of Action to Protect Rural Scotland, which has campaigned for the scheme, said: “This is a bleak day for anyone who cares about Scotland’s litter crisis, or indeed the global climate crisis.

Occupations instead of strikes. End the fossil economy instead of ‘listen to the science’. End Fossil: Occupy! is reigniting the fire of the youth climate movement last seen in 2019.”It is the second time the campaign has called for a wave of occupations, with 50 schools and universities occupied between September and December last year, including three that were violently evicted by riot police. Organisers claim that previous wave of protest spurred Barcelona’s university to make a module on the climate and ecological emergency mandatory for all students.",

So could the leaves, stems and skins of the fruit and vegetables we routinely throw away be put to better use in the kitchen?Pineapple crownsSainsbury’s says the crowns will be replanted or shredded for animal feed, eliminating a huge 700 tonnes of waste a year. So if you regularly buy the fruit elsewhere, it is worth considering what you could do with the leftovers.If you are green fingered you could replant the crown and nurture a pineapple houseplant. But don’t expect fruit salad any time soon, as growing a pineapple will take two to three years, according to Chestnut Hill Farms. The grower’s list of “unexpected ways to use a pineapple crown” offers other ideas with a quicker payback, such as using the leaves to make tea.The Irish chef Conor Spacey, whose book Wasted is full of recipes that use commonly thrown away foods, suggests using the peel and core to make the Mexican drink Tepache. The potion (peel, plus brown sugar, water and cinnamon) self-carbonates into a refreshing fizzy drink that can also be used as a cocktail mixer.Banana skinsThere is a lot more to banana skins than pranks, with an abundance of recipes for this afterthought thanks to the Nigella Lawson effect. In 2020 the TV cook caused a stir with her banana skin and cauliflower curry, telling viewers that people “assume it’s aubergine”. Another twist is Nadiya Hussain’s banana peel burgers, which she says taste like pulled pork.You can store peels in your freezer until inspiration strikes.

A 500-hectare (1,235-acre) study site was divided into 125 experimental plots that, in 2002-03, were either left to recover naturally or planted with a mixture of one, four or 16 native tree species.By 2012, the plots replanted with a mixture of 16 native tree species showed a quicker recovery of canopy area and total tree biomass, compared with areas replanted with four or only a single native species. But even plots replanted with just one tree species recovered more quickly after 10 years than those left to naturally regenerate.A river runs through a rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia. Photograph: Genevieve Vallee/AlamyProf Andrew Hector, of the University of Oxford, who set up the experiment more than 20 years ago as part of the South East Asia Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP), said: “Our new study demonstrates that replanting logged tropical forests with diverse mixtures of native tree species achieves multiple wins, accelerating the restoration of tree cover, biodiversity, and important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration.”The researchers, who published their findings in the journal Science Advances, said that the probable reason for the better recovery was that different tree species occupied distinct niches within the forest ecosystem and so diverse mixtures of planted species complemented each other and increased the effective functioning of the whole ecosystem. For instance, some tropical species were more tolerant of drought because they produced more protective chemicals, giving the forest resilience during periods of low rainfall.Hector added: “Having diversity in a tropical forest can be likened to an insurance effect, similar to having a financial strategy of diverse investment portfolios.”Tropical forests cover 6% of the planet’s land surface but are home to about 80% of the world’s documented species and are major carbon sinks.",

Client Earth, along with three other NGOs, is challenging the inclusion of gas, which it says breaks the EU climate law that sets a legally binding target of reaching net zero emissions by the middle of the century.The cases are the latest legal action against the EU’s “taxonomy for environmentally sustainable economic activities”. Last year a lawsuit was launched by Austria and supported by Luxembourg.Eight national and regional Greenpeace organisations including France, Germany and EU office in Brussels are asking the court to rule the inclusion of gas and nuclear invalid.Nina Treu, the executive director of Greenpeace Germany, said: “The taxonomy was meant to be a tool to meet the 1.5C target [on global heating] and make the European Union climate neutral, fostering social and economic restructuring for the European economy by shifting funds. Instead of hindering greenwashing, it has become a tool for greenwashing.”Gas and nuclear had been included because of “politically motivated lobbying”, Treu said. Greenpeace will tell the court that gas cannot be considered a “transition fuel” because any gas-powered plant that comes online today will still be running beyond 2050.The environment group will also say the construction of new nuclear plants – which usually take one to two decades to build in Europe – will delay the move away from coal power, hinder development of renewables, risk accidents and create pollution.",

The first 200 signs were themed around biodiversity, ecosystems, pollution and the physical environment.To sign “greenhouse gases”, for example, BSL users are told to gesture with “both hands in circular shapes [to] represent gases, then put the left hand at the horizontal position and move the right hand, with the index finger pointing, down and back up to the left hand to show the sunlight reflecting on Earth’s surface”.The team extracted words related to biodiversity, the physical environment and pollution from GCSE and A-level courses, which were then reviewed by environmental scientists and developed into signs.By the end of the project, the team will have developed signs for more than 400 environmental terms. The final 200 will be themed around energy, sustainability, and the impact of environmental change on humans, and will include the terms global warming, carbon neutral and deforestation.Dr Audrey Cameron, the project coordinator at the University of Edinburgh, said the signs would allow BSL users to participate in “the conversation about the current threats to biodiversity and the environment”.

Dingle pies use leftover roast lamb (and its fat), making them both faster to make, and transforming scraps into a seriously satiating, traditional, hand-shaped pie.Dingle piesMcMahon is a staunch advocate of Irish cuisine, both traditional and contemporary, and his The Irish Cook Book (Phaidon) is full of thrifty, home-cooked Irish recipes. His Dingle pies caught my eye as a great way to use up the leftovers from the Easter lamb roast, so I got in touch with JP to learn more about the zero-waste practices at his restaurant Aniar in Galway. He told me they always try to incorporate the whole vegetable into their cooking, and utilise pickling, preservation and fermentation to save food that would otherwise be wasted. Dingle pie, he says, is a really great way of turning one meal into a different one, using up all the leftover meat, fat and juices.These pies are also proof that leftovers often save a lot of time, as well as money, because the filling takes all of 15 minutes to make. (That said, you could start with uncooked lamb: use the same weight of diced shoulder and simmer it in the juices for 90 minutes, or until the meat starts to fall apart.)Save any lamb fat from the roasting pan, too, to sweat the onions in and to make the pastry with. Also, reserve any meat juices or leftover gravy, and use that to cook the pie filling.There’s no need to use clingfilm when making pastry, incidentally. Instead, simply shape it, leave it in the bowl, cover with a plate and chill. I wanted to make JP’s iconic round pies, but didn’t have the right pastry cutters, so instead I used a plate and a jar that were about the right size to cut around.

A more powerful influence is the company’s own shareholders, who have clearly demanded a rethink on previous pledges to slash hydrocarbon output by 40% this decade.Three years ago, when he was fresh in the job, Looney sounded as if he’d made up his mind. “Today is about a vision, a direction of travel,” he declared to an audience of investors and industry analysts. “The direction is set. We are heading to net zero. There is no turning back.”And now? Well, there is still no reversal, BP would argue, because an extra $1bn (£830m) a year until 2030 is going into what the company calls its “transition growth engines” – meaning biofuels, electric charging points, wind, solar and hydrogen. That is what Looney meant when he spoke on Tuesday of “leaning in” to the same strategy.But an equivalent extra sum will also be directed at oil and gas, meaning the ambition of reducing hydrocarbon output by 40% by 2030 has been scrapped in favour of a 25% figure. Whereas BP used to say it would happily live without the “low margin barrels” that would be removed from the production schedule, it now refers to “short-cycle fast-payback opportunities”. This may not count as U-turn, but it is a major detour.The world is “a different place” and “needs energy that is secure and affordable as well as lower carbon”, argued Looney, emphasising the need for an “orderly” transition. Well, yes, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had obviously transformed the economic calculation. Oil is now $80-plus a barrel v $40 when the transition-speak was turned up. That explains the investor pressure to be oily for longer: BP’s shares, even as they rose 7% after the latest results, are still rated substantially lower than those of unashamedly oil-focused ExxonMobil.But one wonders where this plot is going next, and whether even the diluted hydrocarbon pledges are vulnerable to another rethink.",

The rate of extraction is growing globally, Unep said, and is approaching the natural rate of replenishment of 10bn to 16bn tonnes of sand flowing into the sea from rivers and needed to maintain coastal structure and ecosystems.The platform has identified “hotspots” including the North Sea, south-east Asia and the east coast of the United States as areas of concern. In many places where extraction is more intense, including parts of Asia, marine sand is being extracted well beyond the rate at which it is being replenished from rivers.“The scale of environmental impacts of shallow sea mining activities and dredging is alarming, including biodiversity, water turbidity, and noise impacts on marine mammals,” said Pascal Peduzzi, the director of GRID-Geneva at Unep.“This data signals the urgent need for better management of marine sand resources and to reduce the impacts of shallow sea mining,” he said. “Unep invites all stakeholders, member states and the dredging sector to consider sand as a strategic material, and to swiftly engage in talks on how to improve dredging standards around the world.”Developed by GRID-Geneva, a centre for analytics within Unep, Marine Sand Watch has trained artificial intelligence to identify the movement of dredging vessels from its AIS data.

But rather than providing a solution to the threat plastics pose to aquatic life, the tiny creatures known as rotifers could be accelerating the risk by splitting the particles into thousands of smaller and potentially more dangerous nanoplastics.Each rotifer, named from the Latin for “wheel-bearer” owing to the whirling wheel of cilia around their mouths, can create between 348,000 and 366,000 nanoplastics – particles smaller than one micrometre – each day.The animals are microscopic, ubiquitous and abundant, with up to 23,000 individuals found living in one litre of water, in one location. The researchers, from a team led by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, calculated that in Poyang Lake, the largest lake in China, rotifers were creating 13.3 quadrillion of these plastic particles every day.Plastic can take up to 500 years to decompose. As it ages, tiny pieces break off. Physical and chemical processes are known to break them down, including when exposed to sunlight or when waves grind bits of plastic against rocks, beaches or other obstacles floating in the ocean.The scientists sought to examine what role aquatic life might play in microplastic creation, especially after the discovery in 2018 that Antarctic krill are able to break down polyethylene balls into fragments of less than one micrometre. Baoshan Xing, a professor of environmental and soil chemistry at the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Stockbridge School of Agriculture, said they decided to look at rotifers because they had specialised chewing apparatus similar to krill. They wanted to test the hypothesis that rotifers, of which there are 2,000 species worldwide, could also break down plastic.“Whereas Antarctic krill live in a place that is essentially unpopulated, we chose rotifers in part because they occur throughout the world’s temperate and tropical zones, where people live,” said Xing, the paper’s senior author.The animals mistake microplastics – fragments of less than 5mm in diameter – for algae, he said.After exposing marine and freshwater species of rotifers to a variety of different plastics of different sizes, they found all could ingest microplastics of up to 10 micrometres (0.",

Instead, experts are warning that the crisp, sunny days that usually offer relief at the end of a sweltering summer are still some way off, with one describing the weather as “abnormal”.Japan experienced record-breaking heat this summer, with daytime highs exceeding 38C on some days, the public broadcaster NHK said, adding that “disaster-level” heat of 40C had been observed in two cities in early August.‘Major disruptor’: El Niño threatens the world’s rice suppliesRead moreBased on measurements at 15 locations around the country from June through August, Japan’s summer was its hottest since 1898, when the meteorological agency started collecting data.Tokyo has experienced 22 days this year when the mercury topped 35C – the agency’s definition of “extremely hot” weather – easily breaking the previous record of 16 days, set last year.Even Sapporo, the country’s northernmost main city – and venue for a snow festival every February – experiencing three straight days over 35C in late August.

        "text": "The more than 700 pledges that emerged from the UN water conference, which concluded last weekend, were an insufficient response to the worsening global water crisis. But the scientific panel that the UN has committed to create, along with a new water envoy, should help bring greater clarity and raise awareness of the multiplying risks. These include sea level rises, floods, droughts and other extreme weather caused by global heating, and the lack of access of about 2 billion people to clean drinking water. The trouble is that the commitments made by attenders – who included very few world leaders – are voluntary and unenforceable. Given the broken climate pledges of the past, there is every reason to worry that the promises will not be kept.Many participants in the three days of talks in New York were angered by the prominent role played by corporations, including manufacturers who are heavy users of water, and the lack of representation of grassroots organisations from the poorer countries that are the worst affected. As with recent reports of the influence of oil companies in US universities, there are growing concerns about the ways in which businesses are seeking to shape environmental legislation, and public understanding of the threats, to promote their own short-term economic interests.Nonetheless, the UN’s first major conference on water since 1977 was a reminder that scarce resources must not be taken for granted. António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, warned that it is “making our planet uninhabitable” and that “vampiric overconsumption” must stop. Last year’s drought in Somalia, which is estimated to have caused 43,000 excess deaths, and floods in Pakistan, are grim foretastes of what lies ahead. About 10% of the global rise in migration is linked to water shortages, and armed conflict linked to competition for water is also increasing.There are good reasons why dangerous heat tends to be the focus when we think about the climate emergency. Rising temperatures caused by greenhouse gases are the central problem – and one which continues to become more dangerous as emissions keep rising.",

EU leaders, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will be there, but the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has not confirmed whether he will attend.Macron believes current systems of development finance, including overseas aid from rich countries and climate finance to help poor countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather, are not delivering results.“The fight against poverty, the decarbonisation of our economy in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and the protection of biodiversity, are closely intertwined,” he said, setting out the terms for the two-day summit. “We therefore need to agree together on the best means to address these challenges in the poor and emerging countries of the developing world, when it comes to the amount of investment, to comprehensive reform of infrastructure like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and public and private funds, and how to set a new process in motion.”Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, will also play a leading role. Her proposals, known as the Bridgetown agenda, are aimed at massively expanding the funding available to developing countries, particularly those afflicted by the climate crisis.Mottley has fiercely criticised the World Bank, IMF and similar institutions, most of which were set up in the final days of the second world war, calling them unfit for the 21st-century task of tackling the climate crisis and drawing countries out of debt and poverty. “The international community’s responses are currently fragmented, partial and insufficient,” she said. “We therefore call for a fundamental overhaul.”Calls have been growing from many countries, including the US, the EU and UK, for an overhaul of the World Bank.",

But they’re not doing anyone any harm.”Some of the crocodiles seen by rangers had their heads removed, he said, adding there was an illegal market for crocodile parts, including heads.He said wildlife officers were expected to arrive in Normanton on Sunday to join rangers and investigate the deaths.Local fisher Dylan Leschke told the ABC the crocodiles he had found had been shot.“They’re not a threat to our society,” he said. “These people are just getting trigger-happy and trying to shoot them under the radar.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.",

Then, they were asking the festival to call on its sponsor, investment firm Baillie Gifford, to divest from fossil fuels, or otherwise to drop the sponsorship deal. Now, FFB is urging all UK literature festivals and prizes currently receiving sponsorship from Baillie Gifford to join them in calling on the firm to stop fossil fuel investments.“To keep global warming below the critical 1.5°C – and so secure a liveable future – investment in new oil, coal, and gas projects must stop immediately,” the statement reads.“Baillie Gifford currently has up to £5bn invested in the fossil fuel industry, including the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and Petrobras,” it goes on to say. “CNOOC is a shareholder in the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, which is already displacing people from their homes in Uganda and, if it goes ahead, will be the world’s largest heated crude oil pipeline. Petrobras is one of the top 10 companies for projected fossil fuel development and exploration this decade.”Baillie Gifford sponsors a number of literary festivals, including the Hay festival, Cheltenham literature festival and Edinburgh international book festival. It also sponsors the UK’s most prestigious nonfiction award, the Baillie Gifford prize, which announced its 2023 shortlist last week.Responding to FFB, a representative from Cheltenham Festivals said: “We take the climate emergency seriously, and we have centred it within our sustainability action plan. We welcome and encourage robust discussion of these critical issues for our communities, societies and planet. We are aware of previous statements that Baillie Gifford has made on its investments and our work relies on their support.”A representative from Baillie Gifford reiterated its previous words: “We are not a significant fossil fuel investor.",

Her most recent is to recycle the pickling liquid from a jar of gherkins simply by reusing it to pickle more cucumbers, or other vegetables, for a day or two. She was about to chuck out some pickle juice along with a few leftover raw veg sticks that her kids had left on their plates when her inbuilt, food waste-saving mindset cut in, and she thought of this great way to save both food items. It’s now a go-to in her house for saving all sorts of veg, including cucumbers, cauliflower, carrots, celery, bell peppers and onions, and the process produces a delicious, fresh-tasting refrigerator pickle – to be safe, though, be sure to consume it within three days. To preserve the pickles for longer – up to a week – and to give them a stronger pickled flavour, hot pickle them as below.Re-picklesI love how this solves two waste streams at once, and without the need for any other ingredients save for a little salt. Leftover pickle juice is usually full of flavour, and includes all the flavourings that went into creating the original jar. The recycled pickle brine provides an opportunity to save vegetable odds and ends for up to a week, crisping them up and giving them a new lease of life.When I made this, I raided the fridge to see what vegetables needed saving, and found some sweet potatoes, ginger, garlic and chilli. I’d never tried pickled sweet potato before, so thought I’d give it a try (unlike regular potatoes, sweet potatoes can be eaten raw in small quantities). I sliced it into rounds, but left the garlic clove and chilli whole. When you apply hot pickling liquor to vegetables, they’re ready to eat the moment they’ve cooled down.",

It has the potential to produce 500m barrels of oil and its final approval is expected to reach the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, in the next few weeks. It is expected to be approved after Rishi Sunak hinted last month that it would be “economically illiterate” not to invest in UK oil and gas because Britain will remain reliant on fossil fuels for “the next few decades”.Reducing its potential emissions will play a major part in the approval process for Rosebank, with its main backer vowing to develop the “lowest possible carbon footprint” for the project. The environmental statement drawn up by the project’s backers suggests that they are exploring the option of sourcing clean energy from a forthcoming onshore windfarm in nearby Shetland.“Electrification connected to the electrical grid on Shetland has the greatest potential for [greenhouse gas] reduction with the proposed windfarms on Shetland providing a low carbon source of energy via cable,” it states.The Rosebank field is being developed by the Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor, which is now under pressure from campaigners not to monopolise the energy produced by Shetland’s new 103-turbine Viking windfarm, which is being completed.Construction of a section of the Viking windfarm on Riven Hill near Laxo on Shetland. Photograph: SJ Images/Alamy“Rosebank is oil for export and will do nothing to boost the UK’s energy security,” said Tessa Khan, executive director of the campaigning group Uplift. “If it also ends up taking vast amounts of cheap, clean energy that could be used to power hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, it will end up actively reducing the UK’s energy security. This would be laughable if it wasn’t so serious.The project has already faced claims that without such electrification plans, the oilfield will blow a hole in the UK’s carbon budgets that should come from oil and gas production, from 2028 onwards.",

The volume lost during the hot summers of 2022 and 2023 is the same as that lost between 1960 and 1990.The analysis by the Swiss Academy of Sciences found 4% of Switzerland’s total glacier volume vanished this year, the second-biggest annual decline on record. The largest decline was in 2022, when there was a 6% drop, the biggest thaw since measurements began.Visualised: glaciers then and nowRead moreExperts have stopped measuring the ice on some glaciers as there is essentially none left. Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland (Glamos), which monitors 176 glaciers, recently halted measurements at the St Annafirn glacier in the central Swiss canton of Uri since it had mostly melted.Matthias Huss, the head of Glamos, said: “We just had some dead ice left. It’s a combination of climate change that makes such extreme events more likely, and the very bad combination of meteorological extremes. If we continue at this rate … we will see every year such bad years.”He said small glaciers were disappearing because of the rate of ice loss. In order to stop Switzerland losing its ice, emissions needed to be halted, he said, but added that even if the world managed to keep warming to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, only a third of glacier volume in Switzerland was forecast to remain.This meant, he said, that “all the small glaciers will be gone anyway, and the big glaciers will be much smaller”. But he stressed that at least “there will be some ice in the highest regions of the Alps and some glaciers that we can show to our grandchildren”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

However, factual errors were quickly pointed out after publication.The most serious error was the confusion by the report’s author, Ewen Stewart, between power capacity in megawatts (MW) with electricity generation in megawatt hours (MWh). As a result, he presented an unrealistic “£1.3m per MWh” figure for the cost for onshore wind power. The true number is more than 10,000 times lower at about £50 to £70 per MWh. Another error was mixing up billions with trillions.A statement on the Civitas website said: “This report has been taken down from the website because it was found to contain factual errors, it is undergoing revision and a fresh process of peer review. A revised report will be released when this process is completed.”How a thinktank got the cost of net zero for the UK wildly wrong Read moreThis statement replaced an earlier one in which Civitas said the report’s problems were limited to only two paragraphs: “There has been criticism on social media of two paragraphs of this report, where capacity and output are confused.

The fact remains that we are facing a huge bill for net zero that is many times more than official estimates.”The erroneous Civitas estimate of the cost of meeting net zero is far higher than the figure produced by the government’s official adviser, the climate change committee (CCC), which said that reaching net zero would require net investments of £1.4tn by 2050.However, the CCC also found that reaching net zero would generate savings in the form of lower fossil fuel bills worth £1.1tn, resulting in a net cost of £0.3tn.",

After fossil fuels, it is the country’s largest source of national income, and a hugely lucrative one: in 2022, operating profit margins for Norway’s salmon farmers were estimated at 45%.Last September, the Norwegian government set out a proposal to raise taxes on the industry. Aimed at sharing the profits of one the country’s key resources, the idea was widely described as a “salmon tax”, and set at 40% (on top of 22% corporation tax).Within hours, share prices for salmon firms plummeted, with the seafood index on the Oslo Stock Exchange dropping by 25%. Last week, however, the government proposed to press forward regardless, albeit lowering the provisional tax to 35%.The finance ministry has insisted that the controversial levy is designed to ensure that coastal communities receive more of the “value created by fish farming”. Host municipalities will receive more for “schools, elderly care and other welfare services”, it said.The tax extends the principle behind Norway’s pension fund. This type of policy is exactly what’s needed for the 21st centuryProf Guy StandingDefenders of the tax also see it as a way to reduce state reliance on the country’s oil and pension funds, and to offset the government’s increased spending on electricity subsidies amid Europe’s energy crisis.Industry representatives, on the other hand, argue that the new levy will undermine price competitiveness and economic growth.“A 35% ground rent will represent a tripling of the tax level for salmon companies,” Kristin Langeland, of the Norwegian Seafood Federation, said of the proposal.“There have already been layoffs … and there will be less money for investment. The tax will damage Norway’s economy.”Langeland claimed 40bn kroner (£3.1bn) of salmon-linked investments have been postponed or cancelled since last autumn after the government first proposed the tax.While share prices for Norway’s major salmon companies, including Mowi, SalMar and Grieg Seafood, took a hit, observers said smaller producers could stand to benefit.View image in fullscreenA salmon farm in Grovfjord, Norway.

It’s time to address the plastic problem at the source.”Plastic pollution graphicThe researchers looked at 11,777 samples of floating ocean plastics to create a global time series that estimated the average counts and mass of microplastics in the ocean surface layer, lining up the data with international policy measures aimed at reducing plastic pollution to evaluate their effectiveness.It found that from 2005, there had been a rapid increase in the mass and abundance of ocean plastic. This could reflect exponential increases in plastic production, fragmentation of existing plastic pollution or changes in terrestrial waste generation and management.The scientists estimate at least 170tn plastic particles are present in the oceans, with a combined weight of about 2m tonnes.They say without immediate global action on plastic production, the rate of plastic entering aquatic environments is expected to increase approximately 2.6-fold from 2016 to 2040.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

Now that we’re getting rid of many or all of the tailpipe emissions, I think we need to start looking at these quite seriously.”Recent studies have raised concerns about the danger to health from tiny particles produced by tyre wear, as well as from road surfaces and marking, which are now notably greater than those coming from exhausts.Whitty, who explained to the committee how pollution was linked not just to respiratory problems but also heart disease, strokes and even dementia, said indoor pollution was a significant problem, if one less well understood.Citing air fresheners as a hazard, Whitty said that while he did not think the evidence was strong enough to merit government warnings, he would recommend that families with an asthmatic child avoided using them.On outdoor pollution, he highlighted the problems from sources including wood-burning stoves and diesel trains.On the latter, he said, it was “wholly unnecessary” to have diesel engines running on trains in busy stations, saying these should be adapted to use electric power when in a station.Asked about the potential exposure to pollutants for people who walk and cycle in urban areas, Whitty stressed that the health benefits of active travel greatly outstripped any such risks.",

The world has to slash carbon emissions by almost half in the next seven years to remain on track for just 1.5C of global heating and avoid the worst of climate impacts. Yet emissions are rising.However, tucked away in the recent (and devastating) landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a chart that provides the road map for an escape from catastrophe. It assesses with extraordinary clarity the potential for emissions cuts of more than 40 options. You can view it here.The simplicity of the chart is deceptive. It was compiled by a team of the world’s best scientists, based on 175 studies. Its power is amplified by the fact that it was signed off by all of the world’s governments, from the cleanest and greenest to the darkest petrostates.So what does it show? First, solar and wind power are by far the best option, with the potential to cut a staggering 8bn tonnes from annual CO2 emissions by 2030. That is equivalent to the combined emissions of the US and European Union today. Even more startling is that most of that potential can be achieved at lower cost than just continuing with today’s electricity systems.“What struck me especially was that wind and solar was so big,” Prof Kornelis Blok, at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, told me this week. Blok, who led the work on the chart, identified the winners: “The big five are wind, solar, energy efficiency, stopping deforestation and reducing methane emissions.”Just as important as the winners in this analysis are the losers. Nuclear power and carbon capture and storage (CCS) each have just 10% of the potential of wind and solar, and at far higher cost. The same applies to bioenergy – burning wood or crops for electricity. It’s no wonder that the UK’s energy strategy, published last week, received significant criticism: it goes heavy on nuclear and CCS, while ignoring onshore wind.",

You seem to be someone who takes pride in their lawn. Uniform length, is it? Neat stripes? Well watered?Of course it’s well watered. Then you, my friend, are an enemy of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS).What do they hate me for this time? You waste too much water on your lawn. The RHS is urging gardeners to stop using mains water to keep their lawns green, on the basis that it is tremendously bad for the environment.It is? Yes. Watering a lawn can use as much water in an hour as a person uses in a week. With the climate heating, England could face water shortages in as few as 25 years. Not spraying away hundreds of litres of the stuff on your lawn seems like a fantastic place to start.But my lovely grass! It will grow back. You could just wait for it to rain and it will be green again in no time. Or, better still, invest in a water butt.You don’t understand. My lawn is my life. Well-maintained lawns are terrible things. They don’t just suck up water; they are also ruinous for biodiversity.Really? Yes. In 2019, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report named biodiversity loss as one of the biggest threats to the future of humankind.OK, fine, what should I do? You could let your lawn grow out a little. Even slightly longer grass is terrific for pollinators, plant diversity and absorbing greenhouse gas emissions. Plus, if you disturb your grass by mowing it, you are wildly increasing the likelihood of pest and weed invasions.Long brown grass. My neighbours will be so jealous. Another plan would be to create a patchwork lawn.",

Would they be as feisty coming out as they apparently were going in? Would they be happy with their new surroundings?The mother and two kits could not have been more relaxed. It was the dad who fluffed his lines – emerging into the light, he seemed to look up at a bank full of silent volunteers and journalists and think “no chance”. He darted back into his cage, emerged and then went in another cage. Minutes passed before he finally followed the script to join his family.“That was really emotional,” said Paul Hewitt, countryside manager of the National Trust, which was carrying out its third beaver release. “I did not think I would be that emotional but it was incredible.“I think I was expecting them to be really quick and want to escape, but actually they were really chilled.”Beaver releases are helping to increase the landscape’s resilience to the climate crisis, supporters say. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAThe beavers, which were held at Five Sisters Zoo for health screening after arriving from the River Tay catchment in Scotland, were released into a tributary of the River Wansbeck on the National Trust’s Wallington estate in Northumberland. It follows successful releases on Exmoor in 2020 and the South Downs in 2021.Beavers were once a mainstay of British rivers but were hunted for their fur, meat and scent glands to extinction in the 16th century.The Wallington beavers, in a 24-hectare fenced enclosure, become one of very few beaver populations in northern England, and everyone expects them instinctively to begin engineering and improving the landscape.National Trust rangers attempted to give them a head start by laying willow branches over the stream and putting down hay. It seemed to work. “We could hear them chewing so they were eating within a few minutes, which is just extraordinary,” said Hewitt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

There are a limited number of options available for moles really.“Our study highlights how, in such circumstances, we can underestimate the true nature of biodiversity, even in groups like mammals, where most people would assume we know all the species with which we share the planet.”The discoveries raise the number of known Eurasian moles from 16 to 18, and each have their each of which has distinct genetic and physical characteristics.To identify their latest finds, the researchers studied the size and shape of various bodily structures using advanced mathematical analyses, which also allowed them to include museum specimenscollected in the 19th century.A complementary analysis of the moles’ DNA and a detailed comparison with known species confirmed their distinctiveness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

But when they arrived to the forest in Quatsino Sound, they found hundreds of trees that has recently been logged.“It’s absolutely gut-wrenching to see a tree lying on the ground, and to think that it had lived for more than 500 years and then it can be gone in the blink of an eye, never to be seen again,” said Watt, who photographed the forest as part of a grant from the Trebek Initiative, a partnership between the National Geographic Society and the Royal Canadian Geographical Society named after the late Jeopardy host.The trees were downed in a grove in Quatsino Sound on Vancouver Island. Photograph: TJ WattWatt’s images have been used previously to highlight the dramatic change to landscapes after an old-growth forest is cleared.In November 2021, amid mounting public frustration over the destruction of old-growth trees, the British Columbia government deferred logging in 2.6m hectares within the most at-risk forests. The BC government has also pledged to protect 30% of the province’s land area by 2030, part of broader efforts within Canada to meet biodiversity preservation goals.Since outlining its planned deferrals, however, less than half of the proposed areas have been agreed upon by the province and First Nations communities, whose consent is required. A number of First Nations are actively involved in the logging industry and would see a drop in revenues if logging in their territory was halted. Groups such as the Ancient Forest Alliance say more funding is needed to help offset lost forestry revenues among First Nations.",

On oil and gas, he has a bill to encourage greater exploitation of North Sea resources, while Labour wants to stop new licences for fossil fuels.On law and order, there are a range of new policies toughening up sentencing, and measures to tackle knife crime. But there is a good chance Labour will refuse to fall into the trap of opposing many of these measures for fear of being painted as soft on crime.Sunak’s advisers believe the Tories have a strong record on crime rates but Labour begs to differ, highlighting a court system in crisis, crumbling and overcrowded jails and a lack of police responsiveness to crimes such as burglary.With more than 20 bills on offer, many of the other pieces of legislation are carried over from the last session of parliament or dealing with relatively niche issues, such as banning councils from boycotting goods from certain countries on political grounds.00:01:15UK facing ‘significant long-term challenges’, says Charles in king's speech – videoWhat is perhaps most telling about the legislative programme is that there is very little attention paid to some of the issues that voters care about the most: an absence of measures to help the NHS beyond the smoking ban, nothing concrete on education, little on the environment except for a long delayed animal welfare bill, no improvements to employment rights, nor any direct measures to address the cost of living crisis.The closest the speech comes to offering change that has a meaningful impact on people’s lives are Michael Gove’s renters’ reform and leasehold reform bills, designed to improve the housing market.",

By 2021, Belgium had cut its emissions by just 24%.The court rejected arguments that Belgium’s impact on the climate crisis was limited by its small size and found its climate governance to date had violated human rights.Zakia Khattabi, the Federal climate minister, said in a post on X that the judgment – together with the European Commission’s expected response to Belgium’s national climate and energy plan – “constitute levers to strengthen and give credibility to our climate policies”.The court case, which was brought by the nonprofit Klimaatzaak on behalf of more than 58,000 claimants, has dragged on for years through Belgium’s legal system. The ruling builds on a previous verdict that found Belgium’s climate policy inadequate by ordering the government to cut emissions faster.The governments will now have to set a 2030 target of at least 55%, a level of ambition greater than its current obligations of 47% under EU effort-sharing rules.Scientists warn that the new target will still not be enough to keep extreme weather from rapidly growing more violent. An analysis from the Grantham Institute in March found that Belgium would have to cut emissions at least 61% by 2030 to keep the planet from heating 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures, the level for which world leaders have promised to aim. If the right to pollute were to be shared out more equally between everyone on the planet, Belgium’s cuts would have to be even deeper, reaching 81% by 2030.Speaking to the Guardian last month, Khattabi said she knew that the science called for even faster action. “I know that, and I’m convinced of that, but I work on a political reality. And I will be happy if we achieve our goal of 55%.”“Because of our institutional architecture, it’s difficult to have a national [climate] law,” said Khattabi. “Most environmental and climate policy is in the hands of the regions.

Green spaces also help protect against flooding and heatwaves.Local green space (LGS) designations were introduced in 2012 to give green belt-like protections to smaller areas of land that are often identified by communities themselves. Since then, 7,286 LGS areas have been established for reasons including their recreational value, beauty and importance for wildlife.Today’s report found that 711 new local green spaces have been designated since 2022, the majority in northern England. In London, the total number grew by 64%.But while designations have increased in deprived areas, CPRE mapping reveals that a strong correlation persists between deprivation and lack of green space.The study looked at four areas in detail: Blackpool, which has high levels of deprivation and no LGS designations.",

By 2050, water demand around the world is projected to increase by between 20% and 25%.The 25 countries under the most water stress include Saudi Arabia Chile, San Marino, Belgium and Greece. The five facing the highest water stress are Bahrain, Cyprus, Kuwait, Lebanon and Oman.A colour-coded map showing the extent of water stress on countries.Globally, about 4 billion people, or half the world’s population, are exposed to extremely high water stress at least one month a year, according to the Aqueduct analysis. By 2050 the number could be closer to 60%.“Living with this level of water stress jeopardises people’s lives, jobs, food and energy security. Water is central to growing crops and raising livestock, producing electricity, maintaining human health, fostering equitable societies and meeting the world’s climate goals. Without better water management, population growth, economic development and climate change are poised to worsen water stress,” the report’s authors say.According to data from Aqueduct, 31% of global GDP – worth $70tn – will be exposed to high water stress by 2050, up from 24% ($15tn) in 2010. Four countries – India, Mexico, Egypt and Turkey – will account for more than half of the exposed GDP in 2050.The water risk research says increased water stress threatens countries’ economic growth. It also affects food production. The research says 60% of the world’s irrigated agriculture faces extremely high water stress, particularly sugarcane, wheat, rice and maize.

Chantell and Michael Sackett had objected when federal officials required them to get a permit before filling part of the property with rocks and soil.The ruling was the second decision in as many years in which a conservative majority on the high court narrowed the reach of environmental regulations.“While I am disappointed by the supreme court’s decision in the Sackett case, EPA and army [corps of engineers] have an obligation to apply this decision alongside our state co-regulators,” Regan said in a statement on Tuesday.The rule announced on Tuesday revises a rule finalized earlier this year regulating “waters of the United States”. Developers and agriculture groups have long sought to limit the federal government’s power to use the Clean Water Act to regulate waterways, arguing the law should cover fewer types of rivers, streams and wetlands. Environmental groups have long pushed for a broader definition that would protect more waters.The new rule is highly unusual and responds specifically to the supreme court ruling in the Sackett case. Typically, a rule is proposed, the public weighs in and then the federal government releases a final version. This rule changes existing policy to align with the recent supreme court decision and is final.Damien Schiff, a senior attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation who represented the Sacketts, said the Biden administration properly changed rules to eliminate unlawful criteria to protect wetlands.",

Black, a marine biologist with Monterey Bay Whale Watch and the director of the California Killer Whale Project, said the gathering was unique because the animals played in the bay for more than eight hours. Eleven family groups came together, or about 30 whales. Sometimes three or four whales would breach the water at once. Others slapped their tails against the water’s surface, wrestled with one another and swam in loops.“Just like kids that are in a park, they get excited and play with the other kids and may be more active,” Black said. “The little ones were wrestling and rolling like a bunch of puppies.”Little is a relative term. Orca calves can weigh up to 400lbs (180kg) at birth. Killer whales have a “matriarchal society”, Black said, and travel in groups led by a mother or grandmother. They rely on each other to hunt, share responsibilities for rearing calves and divide the burden of teaching their children. They generally travel with one family group, which can include between three and seven orcas.Sometimes three or four whales would breach the water at once in a stunning display put on by the orcas in Monterey Bay, California. Photograph: Daniel Bianchetta/Monterey Bay Whale WatchThat’s what made Sunday’s sighting so unusual. Although researchers know that orcas can communicate with underwater vocalizations, the sounds likely only travel about 10 miles (15km), Black said. With their territory ranging from California to Canada, Black said she doesn’t know how the creatures all decided to “hang out together” in Monterey Bay.Packs of orcas usually travel to the bay in April and May to hunt gray whale calves.",

A further 52,000 deaths came from excessive levels of nitrogen dioxide and 22,000 deaths from short-term exposure to excessive levels of ozone.“The figures released today by the EEA remind us that air pollution is still the number one environmental health problem in the EU,” said Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU’s environment commissioner.Doctors say air pollution is one of the biggest killers in the world but death tolls will drop quickly if countries clean up their economies. Between 2005 and 2021, the number of deaths from PM2.5 in the EU fell 41%, and the EU aims to reach 55% by the end of the decade.Graph of deaths attributable to particulate air pollutionThe WHO, which tightened its air quality guidelines in 2021, warns that no level of air pollution can be considered safe but has set upper limits for certain pollutants. The European parliament voted in September to align the EU’s air quality rules with the WHO’s but decided to delay doing so until 2035.“The good news is that clean air policy works, and our air quality is improving,” said Sinkevičius. “But we need to do better still, and bring pollution levels down further.”For the first time, the EEA estimated the full burden of disease from air pollution. As well as looking at the raw death tolls, the researchers worked out how many more years the population was living with diseases brought on by bad air.Graph showing burden of diseaseFor some health problems, such as lung cancer and ischaemic heart disease, the extra step changed little. But for others, such as asthma, it revealed high levels of suffering that had been overlooked in mortality statistics.“When people get lung cancer, normally they die very quickly,” said Alberto González Ortiz, an EEA air pollution researcher.",

The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the climate crisis remained of “utmost importance”.But the special representative in post from 2013-17, Prof Sir David King, said: “This is extremely disappointing. It’s a very backward step. I do hope that the government has second thoughts and gets a very strong person into this position.”King said he had made 96 official country visits in the two years before the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2015, enabling the UK government to play a leading role in achieving the deal. “The important thing is that the climate change situation is far, far worse now than it was in 2015,” he said.Tom Burke, a former adviser to the first special representative, John Ashton, who was appointed in 2006, said: “The [loss of the post] will clearly be interpreted everywhere as a reduction in Britain’s political focus on climate change.“The government is strengthening [climate work] inside the structure of the FCDO department, but the fact is that without somebody who’s got the foreign secretary’s approval, and the rank of ambassador more or less, you don’t get access to the key players. So it will limit Britain’s ability to influence other countries on climate change.”Burke, now chair of the thinktank E3G, added: “All of the really difficult problems in dealing with climate change are the politics, not the technology or economics. And in order to make a difference in the politics, you have to have access to the key top-level decision-makers in countries.”An FCDO spokesperson said: “Climate change remains an area of utmost importance to this government, and to the foreign secretary, and is a central focus of our diplomatic relations on a daily basis. Our resource and senior representation on climate and environment has grown significantly since the creation of the FCDO, and expanded further since the UK’s Cop26 presidency.",

If you like, use tofu or leftover roast vegetables instead of roast meat, and vegetarian or vegan “fish” sauce.Rice noodles, fish sauce and tamarind concentrate are available in most wholefood stores and large supermarkets. For the less accessible exotic ingredients such as palm sugar, dried prawns and salted daikon, I’ve offered alternatives or left them as optional; otherwise, buy them from south-east Asian food stores or online.

[This is] probably the result of cold homes which, in turn, is linked to fuel poverty.”Marmot added that the effect the climate crisis has on health inequalities is global and that the livelihood and health of people in low- and middle-income countries will be affected to a greater degree than those in high-income countries.He said: “Action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should include housing, transport, work and food. Done with regard to equity, actions in these domains can reduce health inequalities. Clean transport, for example, will reduce air pollution at the same time as it contributes to net zero, with the effect of reducing health inequalities. Without regard to equity, climate-change action could make inequalities worse.”Prof Lea Berrang Ford, the head of the Centre for Climate and Health Security at the UKHSA, made it clear that the negative health effects of climate breakdown will not be distributed equally across the UK, social determinants or generations.The report said that children and young people will experience increasingly severe weather into their retirement, with effects persisting or increasing for their children.",

No river in England passes tests for chemical or biological pollution, and government targets to improve the water quality in rivers will not be met.“Improvements to wastewater plants should be implemented along with more regulations. These efforts are crucial in safeguarding the integrity and safety of our rivers – fundamental elements of both ecosystems and human wellbeing,” said the lead author, Dr Dania Albini, of Oxford’s biology department.Treated sewage released by water companies into rivers and raw effluent that is dumped in rivers via storm overflows is the primary driver of increased nutrients, algae and sewage fungus in rivers, according to the study.Sewage discharge radically alters plant, animal and microbe communities and increases the abundance of harmful species. While runoff from farmland has negative impacts on river water quality, the research reveals that sewage discharge into rivers has a greater impact on water quality and the animals and plants that live in rivers.The findings were published in the journals Global Change Biology and Ecological Solutions and Evidence.Albini said: “Our study highlights the disproportionate impact that sewage discharge has on river quality, presenting an urgent need for a comprehensive action plan targeting the sewage discharge problem.”Sewage from households and businesses is treated by water companies at treatment plants and then discharged into rivers. Raw sewage is also discharged via storm overflows, but this should only take place in exceptional circumstances. Water companies are at the centre of a criminal investigation by the Environment Agency and an inquiry by the financial regulator Ofwat into failures in the way they run their treatment plants.James Wallace, of the UK-based charity River Action, said: “This important research demonstrates yet again the damage from unregulated water companies and agriculture.",

Christian Aid estimates the UK’s “fair share” of this to be about 3.5%, or $15bn.The charity says a wealth tax of the kind envisaged in its report would affect the top 5% of households, with the burden disproportionately borne by the top 1%. “This has the advantage of being levied on those who are likely to be disproportionately high polluters in their consumption and personal investment,” the report says.The entire sum could also be raised through a tax of up to 95% on the excess profits of fossil fuel companies, which are enjoying all-time record surpluses, the report suggests. Or the money could be raised through a combination of measures including air passenger levies, emissions trading schemes and an expanded financial transactions tax, according to the report.Nushrat Rahman Chowdhury, Christian Aid’s climate justice policy adviser, who wrote the report, said: “Climate change is the biggest issue of global injustice facing the world today.

Last month the FTSE 100 company announced it was abandoning plans to cut oil extraction each year for the rest of the decade.Jamie Peters, the head of climate at Friends of the Earth, said it was “utterly ironic for Shell to be calling anything ‘dangerous and irresponsible’”.“Let’s be clear, companies like Shell are fuelling both the climate crisis and the soaring cost of energy. They are profiting from the misery of ordinary people while destroying the planet, and they’re making a cynical case to continue locking us into the volatile fossil fuel markets that are the root cause of the energy crisis,” Peters said.He pointed out that the comments follow news of the hottest June on record and searing heatwaves, and argued they “show just how incompatible and out of touch Shell is with the urgent need to invest in clean, cheap renewables and energy efficiency, so we can all benefit from lower prices and a safe, green future”.Shell last month announced that it would hold its oil and gas production steady until 2030, after previously saying it would cut output by about 1-2% each year.",

In the whole of 2021, 18GW of coal was approved.A Chinese Communist party (CCP) five-year plan from 2016 had placed a heavy emphasis on reducing the use of coal and developing clean energy sources. In 2020 Xi Jinping, China’s leader, pledged that the country would become carbon neutral by 2060.This prompted an era of reduced coal power approvals as local governments sought to keep their local economies in check with Beijing’s priorities. A rise in coal power approvals came in 2020 when the five-year plan came to an end, as local governments anticipated even tighter restrictions on coal expansion in the next round.But in 2021, China suffered huge power outages, leading to a dramatic shift in the CCP’s energy priorities. In September the price of electricity soared as factories reopened to service global demand as the rest of the world emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. But the government had capped prices, so many power plants reduced output rather than operated at a loss.China relies on coal for more than half of its energy consumption. As homes in the colder north of the country faced the prospect of a gruelling winter without heat, the government’s rhetoric shifted from reducing coal to prioritising energy security. That resulted in a “myth that if you build more power plants, that will bring more energy security,” said Xie Wenwen, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace.The war in Ukraine, which sent global energy prices soaring, was “another huge event that fuelled the energy security narrative”.Chinese coal approvals Campaigners argue that in order to meet China’s growing energy needs, it is not more coal that is needed, but a more flexible grid.",

He was fishing for mackerel, with a single line off the back of the boat, when the orca suddenly appeared in the clear water, and hit the stern of the seven-ton boat.“I said: ‘Shit!’” Rutten, who said he had heard about the “Portuguese accidents”, told the Guardian. The whale hit again and again, creating “soft shocks” through the aluminium hull.“What I felt [was] most frightening was the very loud breathing of the animal,” he said. The orca stayed behind the boat “looking for the keel. Then he disappeared ... but came back at fast speed, twice or thrice ... and circled a bit.“Maybe he just wanted to play. Or look me in the eyes. Or to get rid of the fishing line.”This is the same behaviour that has been seen in the Iberian orca population, but it is the first time it has been known to happen in northern waters.Highly social cetaceans, orcas (also known as killer whales) use complex vocalisations to communicate and to hunt for food, from small fish to blue whales. They learn matrilineally, and post-menopausal females assume the greatest importance in individual pods. “Grandmothers” in the Iberian population have been seen observing during the interactions with yachts and other vessels.Experts believe this could be play among juvenile orcas. Dr Alfredo López, of the Grupo de Trabajo Orca Atlántica in Portugal, said: “We know that many boats use fishing lines from the stern to fish and it is a motivation for orcas, they come to examine them.” But the focus on boats’ rudders may come from adult whales who have developed an aversion towards boats, perhaps because they “had a bad experience and try to stop the boat so as not to repeat it”.",

In 2017, a National Geographic article headlined “This tiny country feeds the world” encapsulated a sense of national pride at the Netherlands’ status as the second-biggest exporter of agricultural products by value behind the United States.These days, Dutch farmers are in the headlines for less upbeat reasons. As the climate emergency and a related biodiversity crisis belatedly take centre stage in policymaking, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, has committed to halving the country’s overall nitrogen emissions by 2030. A large proportion of these are generated by the manure and urine produced by more than 100m cattle, pigs and chickens. To reach the target, and protect biodiversity in the polluted countryside, the government has announced plans to reduce livestock numbers by a third. Reluctant farmers have been warned they could be subject to compulsory buyouts.That, at least, is the policy. Turning it into a reality is proving a challenge. As other European countries also look to overhaul their agriculture sectors, Dutch farms have become a test case in navigating the vital politics of the green transition. Last week, protesting farmers confronted the finance minister, Sigrid Kaag, with burning torches. Tractors have blockaded roads, and slurry has been dumped at the home of the minister for nature, Christianne van der Wal. Meanwhile, the far right has successfully co-opted the farmers’ cause, and promoted a toxic conspiracy theory that targeted farmland is being sequestrated in order to build homes for asylum seekers.The intimidation tactics used by elements of the farmers’ protest movement have been rightly condemned. But the rural backlash has generated widespread public sympathy – particularly outside the major cities. Ahead of crucial regional elections this month, a new Farmer-Citizen party is running third in the polls. If it wins enough seats in the Dutch senate to form a blocking alliance with the far right, the aims of the “nitrogen law” could be thwarted.This would send a terrible signal.

The government also plans to scrap pollution rules for housebuilders in sensitive areas, where they are currently not able to add to sewage pollution without paying to improve nearby wetlands.It has also faced criticism for its record on renewables, with its stance on onshore wind referred to by industry as an effective block, and the recent government renewable energy auction failing to sign up any offshore wind.Sunak will further dilute green policies, say campaigners, by giving new powers to planning officials in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). These would allow officials to block any solar project that can be argued to “put food security at risk” – that is, anywhere food is grown.Ministers are understood to believe that food security should be on par with energy security and will use recent climate breakdown-related food shortages in Europe and the war in Ukraine as justification for the change.Rishi Sunak has revived plans to put new restrictions on solar panels.

        "text": "It’s a 66m-year-old decision. Some trees got there much quicker; some took a little longer. But most of the broad-leaved trees that we know and love – the magnolias, plane trees, elms, beech, walnuts, limes, oaks, maples and horse chestnuts – made a calculated decision to drop their leaves come autumn. Large, soft leaves are hard to protect in the winter weather, so the trees evolved to lose them, but not their valuable resources.Leaf fall is a precision art for a deciduous tree – it’s a salvage operation on the greatest scale as the tree works quickly to bank the resources hidden inside the pigments of the leaves. The greens of chlorophyll go first, then the yellows of the xanthonoids, and then the orange carotenoids, until all that is left is brown – at which point the tree lets its foliage go.But the spent leaves that flutter to the ground aren’t a waste product. They are rich in carbon and play an essential role for the tree and the ecology it supports. The leaves act as a physical barrier for soil, keeping it and its many microbes insulated, and also for the tree roots, as the wet mats of autumn leaves shelter the fragile top layer from the drying winds.Many, many things live in these dead leaf layers: caterpillars of moths and butterflies, their chrysalises, beetles, centipedes, springtails, woodlice and spiders … and doesn’t the blackbird know it, rustling through the leaves? Our song and garden birds want these meals far more than they do your imported peanuts.No one loves wet autumn leaves more than earthworms, though. Sensing one of their favourite things, they start to work on incorporating them into the soil. Earthworms line their homes with autumn leaves, using them for bedding and then, because they are good housekeepers, they eat them as they break down. This act brings all that rich carbon into the soil layer so that it is now digested and available for the rest of the food web – the microbes, fungal networks, the protozoa, amoebas, and all the other millions of weird and wonderful things that keep the soil alive.",

But this year, due to an unusually rainy winter, the hatchlings were delayed. The large number of insects moving across Nevada can remain at their peak for four to six years, before being brought back under control by other insects and predators, Knight told the Guardian.“The band of crickets in Elko [Nevada] is probably a thousand acres, and we’ve had bands even bigger than that,” he said. “The drought is probably what triggered them to start hatching.

But “equality” may now be in sight. For decades, those wishing to ride horses on some of the country’s most beautiful off-road routes have had to seek a permit, a bit of paperwork that neither pedestrians nor cyclists need.Forestry England, which oversees that system, maintains that such paid-for permits are important in sensitive sites to avoid damage to the environment or clashes between horse riders and those enjoying a ramble or bike ride through the countryside.The word in equestrian circles in recent days, however, is that despite some suspected reverse snobbery over the perceived high-born status of riders, the “discrimination” of the past may now be coming to an end.A new consultation on the system of permits launched by the forestry agency in recent days and ending on 9 April has given some hope of a more equitable future to Mark Weston, director for access at the British Horse Society (BHS), and the 3 million riders he represents at the charity.“Horse riders should have free access as walkers and cyclists have free access,” he said. “It is discrimination.”“In a lot of forests there aren’t permits at all, which just demonstrates to us that they are not really needed,” he added. “Forestry England’s justification is that the cost of the permits is reinvested into the routes but our view is that it doesn’t really happen and if it does happen, well, walkers and cyclists are benefiting from that investment at the cost of equestrians.”The BHS argues that there is a strong safety argument for better access: in 2022 alone, 68 horses were killed on Britain’s roads and 139 people were injured.Nevertheless, the way forward could be heavy going.There have been well-publicised clashes between cyclists and horse riders, most recently in the New Forest national park in Hampshire where a horse riding group called out a growing number of “rude and abusive cyclists”.",

It is wonderful to see these beautiful flowers return to Stonehenge after 180 years.”To highlight and recreate the spectacle of the Stonehenge dahlia shows, floral sculptures, including a giant trilithon, have been fashioned by local growers, flower arranging clubs and professional florists within a meadow of blooms at the site’s replica neolithic village.Preparations for the Stonehenge dahlia show. Photograph: Jim Holden/English HeritageDahlias grown by members of the National Dahlia Society, will be displayed on Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the visitor centre, where a prize bloom will be chosen.Families will also have the chance to pose in front of the ancient stones wearing dazzling dahlia headdresses created by an expert florist.Originating from Mexico and Central America, dahlias became widely known in the UK after the Napoleonic wars, attracting devoted followings.“They were considered really exciting and exotic plants and a challenge to grow,” said Crawley. “A hype grew up around them and dahlia shows began to be organised.”The Salisbury Plain Dahlia Society was set up in 1838 with its shows at first taking place in the grounds of the Crown Inn in Everleigh.From 1842-45, Lady Antrobus, whose husband Sir Edmund Antrobus owned the land Stonehenge sits on, welcomed it to the stone circle. An advert for the event said it was “open to all England” and prizes would be on a “liberal scale”.",

The slight reduction in 2020 as a result of coronavirus lockdowns was no more than a “tiny blip”, and emissions have since resumed their upward trajectory.Line chart showing CO2 emissions over timeThe causes (II): forest destructionThe felling of forests for timber, beef, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to CO2 emissions. It is also a significant cause of the annihilation of wildlife.Slope chart showing global forest loss over timeThe causes (III): methane emissionsMethane is a potent greenhouse gas and causes 25% of all global heating today. Fossil fuel extraction, cattle, rice paddies and landfills are responsible. There has been a “scary” surge in methane emissions since 2007, according to scientists, potentially due to wetlands heating up.Line chart showing methane emissions over timeThe consequences: global temperature riseThe planet’s average temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago and has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population have risen. Many records were smashed in 2023, which will be the hottest year on record. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense.Bar chart showing monthly average global temperature anomalies over timeThe consequences: rising sea levelsSea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand.

I take very personally the importance of the fact that America led the world in the automotive revolution. Now we are in the midst of a second automotive revolution, it’s critical America do so once more.”There are about 170,000 electric vehicle chargers in the US, a huge leap from a network that was barely visible prior to Biden taking office, and the White House has set a goal for 500,000 chargers to help support the shift away from gasoline and diesel cars.“The US is taking the lead globally on electric vehicles,” said Ali Zaidi, a climate adviser to Biden who said the US is on a trajectory to “meet and exceed” the administration’s charger goal. “We will continue to see this buildout over the coming years and decades until we’ve achieved a fully net zero transportation sector,” he added.Electric vehicle sales are growing in the US, with more than 1m new EVs sold for the first time last year, accounting for 9% of all vehicle sales. But the rate of this increase has slowed somewhat and companies such as Ford, General Motors and even Tesla have scaled back their EV ambitions in recent months.American drivers are confronted by an expanding range of EVs that still are mostly more expensive than gasoline equivalents, meaning they aren’t accessible to many buyers – research has found people who purchase EVs have a median household income of $186,000.",

There are, for instance, nearly 10,000 bird species worldwide. In his new book, naturalist Stephen Moss wisely chooses just 10, but in doing so tells the story of the long relationship between birds and humanity – and it has mostly been a disastrous one.Egrets, for instance, were hunted almost to extinction for their snow-white feathers, or aigrettes, which became the accessory of choice for wealthy women. During the first three months of 1885, 750,000 skins of little and snowy egrets were auctioned in London. In China, Mao Tse-Tung ordered the mass extermination of sparrows as part of a campaign against the Four Pests (the other targets were rats, flies and mosquitos). Some 1bn birds were slaughtered – one boy became a national hero for single-handedly strangling 20,000 sparrows with his bare hands. This led to their near extinction and contributed indirectly to the Great Famine that killed between 15 and 55 million people, since the sparrows were no longer available to prey on the insects that ruined crops.Egrets were not the only species that earned human beings huge profits. In one fascinating chapter, Moss tells the story of the Guanay cormorant and the astronomical sums made from their nitrogen- and phosphate-rich poop – or brown gold, as it was called. Between 1840 and 1879, at today’s values, an estimated £6.1 to £9.1bn worth of guano in today’s money was shipped from Peru. Thousands of indentured workers died in terrible conditions harvesting it.Moss is also a companionable narrator, often mixing personal recollections into the science and natural historyThe book is packed with remarkable facts and figures like this.

Which way to look?Their mismatched eyes solve the problem – by letting them gaze into both worlds at once.The squid are born with two identical eyes, but the left eyeball grows much faster, eventually forming a long tube, often with a bright yellow lens. This huge, highly sensitive eye gazes upwards and looks for the dark silhouettes of food or enemies passing overhead. The yellow colour filters out background light and breaks the camouflage of glowing animals that try to blend with the blue around them.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world’s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures.

We found that activity is higher in the areas with wolves.” said Dr Francesca Brivio, who co-authored the study with colleagues at the University of Ferrara.In conjunction with findings of similar studies, the research supports the hypothesis that increasing night-time activity may be a common strategy for mammals to deal with heat stress caused by global heating.Brivio said: “We can expect that during the night when the temperature is lower other animals will shift their activity towards the nocturnal hours. If during the day it is too hot to eat or to be active, they will prefer to perform all their activities, like foraging, at night”Higher levels of nocturnal activity among Alpine ibex could affect the animal’s population dynamics.Brivio said: “As they are animals adapted to diurnal activity, being active during the night is probably harder. Their movement in the rocky slopes where they live is probably more difficult, which could make the foraging efficiencies and foraging strategies less efficient.",

He is the chair of League Two’s Forest Green Rovers, known as the “world’s greenest football club”.Vince told the Guardian: “We want to prove that one of the last frontiers [of decarbonisation] can be broken and that it’s not insolvable.“A lot of people seem to think that people who are eco-conscious want everyone to live a life of self-denial in a cave. Green living is not about giving things up – everything we like to have in this life can be done in a net zero life.”The airline will launch with several green-striped 19-seater planes capable of travelling for 300 miles. Vince hopes to expand the number of routes out to cover all of Britain’s big cities.Staff will wear environmentally friendly uniforms, and serve plant-based meals.A second phase, 18 months later, will result in 70-seater planes capable of flying to Europe being introduced. The company is in the process of applying for a licence from the Civil Aviation Authority and securing takeoff and landing slots at airports.However, the process of launching an airline is regarded as slow, and Ecojet will not launch as an electric plane operator, starting by using kerosene-based fuel instead.Vince admitted he was not entirely happy with starting the project by burning fossil fuels but said that the airline needed to launch quickly to secure planes and landing slots and “keep up the momentum” of the project.“It does feel like a contradiction but at the heart of this project is upcycling existing planes and retrofitting them. This is the pragmatic approach, which means we won’t lose time.",

A number of other cities around the UK, including Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester and Bristol, have introduced or are discussing LTNs.A number of these have proved controversial, with critics arguing that filtering residential streets simply pushes traffic elsewhere, notably on to main roads and high streets, forcing congestion, noise, pollution and danger towards poorer residents.The study, by Prof Rachel Aldred and Dr Ersilia Verlinghieri from Westminster University’s Active Travel Academy with climate charity Possible, stresses, however, that measures should be taken to alleviate traffic flow on bigger roads.Q&AWhat is a low-traffic neighbourhood (LTN)?ShowIn essence, low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) are residential roads in which bollards, planters or strategic “point closures” allow vehicle access to all addresses in a neighbourhood but reduce through traffic. Along with vehicle barriers, pavement widening and other measures are also often introduced. This is intended to make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists as well as reduce air and noise pollution.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But it notes that across London about 90% of people live on residential streets, with few disparities across demographic differences such as income, age, ethnic background, disability and access to a car. At least 87% of people from each group lived on a residential street.The authors said: “Interventions in general that improve all residential streets within an area should benefit most people living there in each demographic category.",

The legislation was to ban live exports of farm animals as well as clamping down on puppy smuggling and dog theft.However, in parliament on Thursday environment minister Mark Spencer confirmed the legislation would be scrapped.“Unfortunately this multi-issue nature means … the bill risks being extended far beyond the original commitments in the manifesto and the action plan,” he said. “In particular Labour is determined to play political games by widening the scope of this bill.” This hints at fears among some Conservatives that the bill could have been used to argue for curbs on hunting and farming.Spencer also announced a new animal sentience committee, which will begin its work next month, and a consultation on higher fines for animal abuse and neglect.The Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation (Cawf) made up of influential Tory patrons including Carrie Johnson, Michael Gove and Zac Goldsmith, has criticised the decision.Animal welfare groups lose court challenge over ‘Frankenchickens’Read moreLorraine Platt, co-founder of the group, said: “Cawf is disappointed by the statement delivered today. We believe this represents a missed opportunity to further enhance the welfare and protection of animals across the United Kingdom. The kept animals bill is strongly supported by MPs, NGOs, charities, and the public alike. Its provisions, which include ending live animal exports for fattening and slaughter, and tackling puppy smuggling, resonate with the public’s priorities and deliver critical Conservative manifesto commitments.“Almost 14 million people elected this government on a platform which promised to deliver for animals. More recently, the continuation of this bill was promised by prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in 2022 during his leadership campaign. It is these promises we call on the government to honour today, and ensure that the provisions to improve the lives of huge numbers of animals set out in the kept animals bill are carried out in legislation.",

While my one flight across the country was not enough to cause this on its own, I was still contributing to a catastrophic collective consequence that everyone else on Earth is already paying for.The life of a wealthy person burns up a lot of carbon – through superyachts, frequent travel on private jets and helicopters, and multiple enormous homes. According to Oxfam, billionaires emit a million times more greenhouse gases than the average person.This is not an accusation.

Labour will speed up planning to build the homes we need without trashing the environment.”Rayner said: “The Tories are being thoroughly disingenuous in suggesting that the only way we can build the homes we need in sensitive river catchment areas is by weakening environmental law. Don’t fall for it.“Labour will table our own amendment when this is put to a vote in the Lords [on Wednesday]. Our amendment would force the government to launch, complete and publish a consultation within three months to consider alternative ways to reform nutrient neutrality regulations.”Michael Gove, the housing secretary, and Thérèse Coffey, the environment secretary, recently announced they would be ending what they termed “defective” EU laws, which require developers to offset any extra nutrient pollution they cause in sensitive areas, under the habitats directive. These areas include the Lake District and Norfolk Broads.Ministers are aiming to remove the legal requirement via an amendment in the House of Lords, which requires local authorities to ignore potential pollution risks when approving developments. It will be debated on Wednesday. Gove and Coffey’s amendment proposes that instead of forcing housebuilders to invest in local wetland sites to soak up any extra sewage pollution and mitigate damage, this legal requirement would be scrapped and taxpayer money would instead be used to double the funds for a scheme by Natural England to reduce nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates in waterways. These nutrients choke the life out of rivers and cause damaging algal blooms.It was unclear as to whether Labour would back the amendment.",

From my experience as a member of and advocate for minority communities in the UK, it has become increasingly evident that time in the natural world is far less accessible to some of us than we would hope.I’ve been adventuring in the outdoors for nearly 20 years now, and from the very beginning I noticed that I wouldn’t bump into people like myself in rural spaces, despite my city being very diverse.One might think that nature, being free, is available to all. But free isn’t enough when we consider the barriers faced by minority communities. Geographical limitations are often the first hurdle: most minority communities are based in urban areas, making it an endeavour both in terms of time and resources to travel to rural areas. A recent study showed the whitest areas of the country enjoy an astounding 144% more local footpaths than the most ethnically diverse.When the pandemic hit, I sensed there was an opportunity to start improving the diversity in our rural spaces, while tackling loneliness and connecting communities at the same time. I founded Muslim Hikers, a global movement that is now the largest community in the world for Muslims interested in the outdoors. What started as an online community quickly grew to include walking events, where we meet up and enjoy these spaces together.We set out to normalise these activities for underrepresented communities like ours, because barriers to accessing rural spaces are just the tip of the iceberg. Cultural norms can also play a significant role in deterring minority groups from engaging with the outdoors. In communities where outdoor activities have not been traditionally emphasised, there’s a lack of knowledge about where to go, what to wear and how to prepare for something like a hike or camping trip. This absence of knowhow becomes self-perpetuating, preventing new generations from developing a relationship with the natural world.View image in fullscreen‘Organisations like Muslim Hikers (above, on a trip to Malham Cove, North Yorkshire), while geared towards specific communities, are promoting wider diversity in the outdoors.",

I want to empower people with the knowledge to start their own supply of homegrown food, in order to stop relying completely on big corporations and start being more self-sufficient. You don’t need any specific skills to do this: by following some easy and basic steps you will be able to grow your own organic food at home.Supermarkets sell grow-at-home lettuce plants that stay fresh for longer. But what about one that grows back after you cut it, meaning you won’t have to buy it again for months? You can spend what you save on new plants, as once you start you will be hooked. The more that plants enter my living space, the happier I feel.Direct sowing is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to start growing. It just means that you sow seeds directly in the area where you want your plant to be, rather than starting them indoors and moving them out, or starting them in trays and transplanting.Micro salad seedling plugs.

And one of the best ways to filter that water is oysters. Indeed, the European native oyster was so plentiful in Scotland that 30 million a year were harvested from oyster beds outside Edinburgh in the 1800s.But today the species is almost extinct: populations have dropped by 85% over the past century, most likely because of overfishing from bottom trawling.A new rewilding project part-funded by the Glenmorangie distillery plans to use native oysters a water filters, which would prevent the quality of the company’s whisky from deteriorating, but also mitigate the effects of the organic waste released into the waters of Dornoch Firth. In addition, researchers say the process could increase biodiversity in the area by 50% by the end of the decade.Prof Bill Sanderson, of Heriot-Watt University, diving in Loch Ryan. Photograph: Richard ShucksmithThe scheme would reintroduce 4 million oysters to the Dornoch Firth, on the north-east coast of Scotland, by 2030. As well as helping other species, it could treble the amount of carbon going into the seabed, say scientists working on the project in a new peer-reviewed paper.The Dornoch Environmental Enhancement Project (Deep) is a partnership between Edinburgh’s Heriot-Watt University, the Glenmorangie distillery and the Marine Conservation Society. To predict its potential impact, Heriot-Watt researchers studied Scotland’s last remaining oyster fishery, in Loch Ryan, near Stranraer.The fishery, which has operated since 1701, is unusual in that it uses a rotational harvest system. Different areas are fished, left to repopulate for six years, then fished again, allowing recovery.The work allowed researchers to see how biodiversity increased over time if oysters were left undisturbed, and has been published in the peer reviewed journal, Plos One.Naomi Kennon, the lead author and PhD researcher in restorative ecology at Heriot-Watt, says: “The findings from our research in Loch Ryan are extremely exciting, demonstrating that biodiversity will probably double over a decade once oyster restoration projects are complete. This means the population of species will increase in a balanced way.",

It adds to growing evidence of blurred lines between the UAE’s Cop28 team and its fossil fuel industry.In January, Adnoc’s chief executive, Sultan Al Jaber, who also serves as the UAE’s climate change special envoy, was announced as Cop28 president, which is being hosted in Dubai in November and December. Since then, multiple reports have raised concerns about ties between his two teams. The Cop28 team previously stated that there were “clear governance guidelines in place to ensure the team can operate entirely independently from any other entity”.“It is wholly inappropriate for Adnoc staff to be doing PR for Cop28,” said Pascoe Sabido, a researcher from Corporate Observatory Europe who co-coordinates the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition. He says the findings clearly demonstrate the close links between the oil company and the summit team.Earlier this year, CCR and the Guardian revealed that several members of Adnoc staff had taken up important roles at the summit, including as climate negotiators. Some had even been seconded from ongoing roles with the oil company.In June, the Guardian reported that Adnoc and Cop28 shared an IT system and that Adnoc staff were able to read emails sent to and from the Cop28 team. Adnoc had also been consulted on how to respond to a media inquiry about the summit. At the time, the Cop28 team insisted that the emails were held on a “standalone, firewall-protected network”.The two Adnoc communications executives named in the leaked document – Philip Robinson and Paloma Berenguer – have a combined 28 years of experience in the fossil fuel industry, according to their LinkedIn accounts.

There are now 280 and they are restricted to rotational grazing of lowland farmland, allowing many more wildflowers and plants to flourish.The butterfly returned to Swindale because of a big increase in its food plant, devil’s-bit scabious. Previously, the valley meadows had become dominated by coarse grasses that the sheep refused to eat. When the RSPB introduced native fell ponies to graze every late autumn, they devoured the coarse grasses.“The next spring, it was absolutely carpeted in heath spotted orchids and later in the summer masses of devil’s-bit scabious,” said Lee Schofield, a senior site manager for the RSPB at Haweswater.“These flowers have spread and spread over the last few years. The fell ponies are the key to this success – if we hadn’t changed the grazing and used these big native herbivores we wouldn’t have the scabious and we wouldn’t have the butterfly.”Highland and belted Galloway cattle have also been brought back to lightly graze the meadows, and a more natural hydrology has been restored, creating more damp ground where the flowers thrive.“I’ve never seen so much devil’s-bit scabious and I’d be surprised if we don’t see the marsh fritillary popping up throughout Swindale valley,” said Schofield, whose book, Wild Fell, documents the transformation of the Lakeland reserve and the wider landscape.The grazing changes have also benefited grasshoppers, grass-feeding moth species and other butterflies, including the dark green fritillary and the small pearl-bordered fritillary.",

Alarms signalling spills at treatment works were not acted upon for several hours at two sites, the investigation found.District Judge Matson, sitting at Plymouth magistrates court on Wednesday, sentenced the company on 13 charges – six for illegal water discharge activities and seven for contravening environmental permit conditions.Matson said “incidents of pollution will no longer be tolerated by these courts” and fined South West Water £2.15m. The company, which had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing, was also ordered to pay costs of £280,000 and a £170 victim surcharge.The EA said chemicals were discharged from the treatment works sites “on more than one occasion”, causing significant environmental damage to sites at Kilmington, on the River Axe, and Crediton, on the River Creedy.Thousands of fish died in the Axe after the discharge, including some protected species, the agency said.South West Water breached permit rules in Lostwithiel in July 2016 by pumping raw sewage into the River Fowey. Control room alarms showed there was something wrong with the works but the discharge continued for more than 12 hours.Alarms also went off at at Watergate Bay treatment works in August 2016 but no action was taken and sewage was illegally discharged into the coastal waters for more than 35 hours. E coli levels were found to be 2,000 times higher than the level at which water quality would be classified as poor.On two occasions, effluent from the Torpoint sewage treatment works was pumped into a site of special scientific interest at St John’s Lake and into part of a special area of conservation (SAC), both designated as such for their variety of bird life and invertebrates.",

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The last confirmed sighting of the dragon was in the Geelong area in 1969. Once commonly found in native grasslands west of Melbourne, the reptile’s numbers declined due to habitat degradation and fragmentation, inappropriate livestock grazing, and predators such as feral cats.Ecologists had previously made “considerable but unsuccessful efforts” to locate the species in recent years. Zoos Victoria had been actively searching for the dragon since 2017.The animal is listed as critically endangered under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act and the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.An investment of $188,000 will be made by the Victorian government to find more populations of the ‘critically endangered and cryptic lizard’. Photograph: Melbourne ZooThe lizard lacks an external ear opening and functional ear drum, and measures about 15cm from head to tail when fully grown.For conservation reasons, the state and federal governments have declined to reveal the location of the newly rediscovered population, but they say surveys are ongoing to better understand the site’s population size.The Victorian and federal governments will invest $188,000 in a trial of detection dogs to sniff out more populations of the dragon, which Tanya Plibersek, the federal environment minister, described as an “effective and non-invasive way to find this highly cryptic and critically endangered lizard in the wild”.Plibersek said in a statement: “I want to protect our precious creatures for our kids and grandkids. It’s such exciting news that the Victorian grassland earless dragon has been rediscovered.

Most of the countries studied expect to spend less than 2% of their budgets on climate adaptation – and many would be investing less than 1%.Matthew Martin, DFI’s executive director, said a major programme of debt cancellation on the scale of the initiatives of the late 1990s and early 2000s was needed. Debt service averaged 38% across 139 countries in the global south, rising to 57.5% for the low-income countries.Martin said: “If the international community is serious about confronting the climate crisis, they need to get serious about comprehensive debt relief for a wide range of countries.“If we bring countries’ debt service down to 15% of their revenues, as under the heavily indebted poor country initiative, we will have enough money to confront the climate crisis head-on.”The report by DFI, a debt campaign group, said debt was already playing a key role in preventing countries from scaling up investments in tackling global heating.The struggle to repay creditors might even be exacerbating the climate crisis, with countries forced to maximise exports to generate the foreign exchange required to meet the high cost of servicing debt. This has often meant continuing fossil fuel extraction that was profitable in the short term and even expanding fossil fuel projects, potentially delaying their own energy transitions in the process.",

And people buy those tickets every day,” said Don Gann, 35, of North Arlington, New Jersey, a commercial diver who has been out on the water since early last week, with his brother and two workers.It all started when John Reeves, an Alaskan gold miner with a passion for fossils, appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience on 30 December to talk about his land, where he has uncovered bones and tusks and where, in the early 20th century, digging for gold unearthed prehistoric mammal remains.Some of that material was brought to New York, to be given to the American Museum of Natural History. Reeves cited a draft of a report by three men, including one who worked at the museum, that included a reference to some fossils and bones deemed unsuitable for the museum being dumped in the river.“I’m going to start a bone rush,” Reeves told Rogan, before reading from the draft and giving out a location: FDR Drive, at around 65th Street.“We’ll see if anybody out there’s got a sense of adventure,” he said, adding: “Let me tell you something about mammoth bones, mammoth tusks – they’re extremely valuable.”The American Museum of Natural History said: “We do not have any record of the disposal of these fossils in the East River, nor have we been able to find any record of this report in the museum’s archives or other scientific sources.”Reached by phone, Reeves told a reporter to read the draft he posted on social media. Those pages identify as the authors Richard Osborne, an anthropologist; Robert Evander, who worked in the museum paleontology department; and Robert Sattler, an archeologist with a consortium of Alaska Native tribes.Sattler said the story about the dumped bones came from Osborne, who died in 2005.",

Seven EU countries, including France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, have already said they will quit the ECT.More than 100 academics have written to the UK government, stating that “continued membership of the ECT will harm our prospects of limiting global warming to 1.5C because it will prolong the UK’s dependence on fossil fuels and impede the transition to renewable energy”.The ECT’s courts were set up in 1994 to protect energy companies working in former Soviet Union countries from government expropriation. The UK has backed “modernisation” of the treaty, which has 50 member states. But critics say the court system would remain in place for oil and gas projects for at least a decade, during which time carbon emissions must be reduced by half to keep the 1.5C goal within reach.The academics’ letter was sent to Grant Shapps, the secretary of state for the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. “Investors have already brought cases against countries for phasing out coal-fired power stations, banning the exploitation of oil and gas near their coastline, and requiring environmental impact assessments,” the group said.“There is also evidence that countries are shying away from introducing new legislation for fear of being challenged in claims under the ECT,” the academics said. “We urge you to take this opportunity to announce that the UK will withdraw.” The UK and Japan are the last large economies not to have said they will leave the ECT.A government spokesperson said: “The UK is closely monitoring the situation surrounding the energy charter treaty’s modernisation process, including the positions taken by other [member nations]. We have been a strong advocate for updating the treaty to ensure it is aligned with modern energy priorities, modern international treaty practice, and international commitments on climate change.",

The heat index – which takes into account both the temperature and humidity – was 100F (37C) while he was working.It was an omen of what could come after HB 2127 takes effect in September, wrote the Texas branch of the AFL-CIO union, referring to the far-reaching law that not only curbs cities’ right to enact worker protections, but a number of labor, agriculture, natural resources and finance measures. “Banning required rest breaks for construction workers in the Texas heat is deadly.”The law’s passage has enraged workers’ advocates, who warn that it will result in even more heat-related deaths and illnesses in a state that already tallies the highest number of worker deaths due to high temperatures.“In the midst of a record-setting heatwave, I could not think of a worse time for this governor or any elected official who has any, any kind of compassion, to do this,” said David Cruz, the communications director for League of United Latin American Citizens National (Lulac), a Latino civil rights group. “This administration is incrementally trying to move us backwards into a dark time in this nation. When plantation owners and agrarian mentalities prevailed.”Six out of every 10 construction workers in Texas are Latino, and labor advocates say that the law will hurt Latino and Black communities that are already disproportionately affected by extreme heat. Hispanic workers made up a third of all worker heat deaths since 2010, according to an NPR/Columbia study.",

The twins were asked to rate their familiarity with and desire to be in nature, and how frequently they visit natural spaces such as public parks and private gardens.The study, published in Plos Biology, found that identical (monozygotic) twins, who share almost 100% of their genes, were more similar to each other in their orientation towards nature and how frequently they visited nature compared with fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who share about 50% of their genetic material.However, heritability declined with age, perhaps showing that environmental factors such as access to nature and green spaces bring about a love of the outdoors as one grows older.While previous studies have found that spending time in natural spaces improves mental wellbeing, this varies from person to person. For the first time, the researchers say, this study has indicated why that is by suggesting there is likely to be a genetic component in our predispositions towards nature and our likelihood to visit natural spaces.",

Kids are normally healthy during the warmer months: the risk of colds and flu is low, and their bodies are invigorated by sunshine and exercise. They might suffer the odd scrape or broken bone from playing outside, but nothing that would land them in hospital in the middle of the night.Not this summer. Something is different. I spent the first week of July working nights in the A&E of a major central London hospital, and it was full of children. Rushing between the emergency room and the ward, I barely had a moment to myself from 8pm when I started my shift to 10am when I handed over to the day team. It’s not normal.

But even if they do, onshore wind developers warn that the changes are unlikely to be sufficiently wide-ranging to kickstart significant new generation.A Downing Street spokesperson said on Monday: “We support the development of onshore wind where there is local support. Applications will continue to be decided at a local level.”Developers say the changes would still leave an effective ban in place, while Labour’s Ed Miliband promised to give onshore wind parity with other infrastructure projects.Under the current system, a local authority in England can reject an application to build an onshore windfarm on the basis of a single objection from a local resident. Any new development must also have been included in the authority’s most recent local development plan, a document that covers several years’ worth of building schemes.These requirements, which are not applied to other energy sources, were put in place in 2015 by David Cameron under pressure from many of his own MPs, who did not support the widespread development of onshore wind.Collectively, they have contributed to new onshore wind development almost stalling, leading critics to call them a “de facto ban”. Only 20 onshore wind turbines have received planning permission since 2015 – just 2.7% of the number granted permission between 2009-14, before the restrictions were put in place.No 10 decided to act last year after 34 Tory MPs, including the former prime ministers Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, signed an amendment in support of more onshore wind.",

It can affect people of any age in any country and is already killing 1.3 million people a year, according to estimates.chartThe main drivers are still the misuse and overuse of antibiotics, which are used to treat infections. But the study suggests the problem is being worsened by rising levels of air pollution.The study did not look at the science of why the two might be linked. Evidence suggests that particulate matter PM2.5 can contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes, which may be transferred between environments and inhaled directly by humans, the authors said.Air pollution is already the single largest environmental risk to public health. Long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with chronic conditions such as heart disease, asthma and lung cancer, reducing life expectancy.Short-term exposure to high pollution levels can cause coughing, wheezing and asthma attacks, and is leading to increased hospital and GP attendances worldwide.Curbing air pollution could help reduce antibiotic resistance, according to the study, the first in-depth global analysis of possible links between the two. It also said that controlling air pollution could greatly reduce deaths and economic costs stemming from antibiotic-resistant infections.The lead author, Prof Hong Chen of Zhejiang University in China, said: “Antibiotic resistance and air pollution are each in their own right among the greatest threats to global health.",

Before the climate crisis, such an extreme event would have been expected only once in a least 40,000 years, making it statistically impossible on human timescales.The scientists said such heat early in the year was especially harmful to people, who were less prepared than in summer. Farmers were already suffering under a prolonged drought and the heatwave struck at an important time in the crop-growing season, particularly for wheat.Extreme temperatures in the region are increasing faster than predicted by climate models – a problem that worries scientists – and intensive research is in progress to understand the reasons.Human-caused global heating was already known to be increasing the severity and frequency of heatwaves. But the number of extreme events that would have been essentially impossible without the climate crisis is rising, destroying lives and livelihoods across the planet.In April, scientists showed that the devastating drought in the Horn of Africa would not have happened without global heating. A Guardian analysis in 2022 found that at least a dozen serious events, from killer heatwaves to broiling seas, would have been all but impossible without human-caused global heating.“The heatwave was a rare event in current climates, but an event of this extremity would have been almost impossible in the past colder climates, and we will see more intense and more frequent heatwaves in the future,” said Dr Sjoukje Philip at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, one of the researchers who conducted the study as part of the World Weather Attribution collaboration.“The Mediterranean is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in Europe,” said Dr Friederike Otto, at Imperial College London, who was one of the study team. “These heatwaves are definitely not going away, so these kinds of conditions will occur ever more frequently until we stop emitting greenhouse gases.",

You are trapped, too, like a sheep in its wool: you are in the present, there is no going forward until the season is on its way.In Things I Don’t Want to Know, Deborah Levy is carrying her luggage up a steep path on a mountain in Spain. “The smell of wood fired in the stone houses below and the bells on sheep grazing in the mountains and the strange silence that happens in between the bells chiming suddenly made me want to smoke.”Conservation efforts celebrated as 26 Australian species no longer need threatened listingRead moreIt is spring.

It makes me wonder if the marine ecosystem is changing.”Experts have speculated that the migratory fish in both areas had become stranded after being chased to the point of exhaustion by amberjack and other predatory fish. Mass mortality events can also occur when there are sudden drops in the water temperature, causing the fish to go into shock, they added.But no one has been able to confirm the cause. “The cause is unknown at the moment,” Mikine Fujiwara, a local fisheries official, told the newspaper. “We plan to sample the seawater at the site and examine it to uncover the cause.”Japanese government officials have blasted a report in the British newspaper the Daily Mail that appeared to link the phenomenon to the release of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Local authorities are urging people not to consume the fish.

Members of the public are asked to spend 15 minutes in a local park, garden or green space recording the butterflies they see.So far this year, numbers of common butterflies including small tortoiseshells and peacocks whose caterpillars were feeding on nettles late last summer are significantly lower than normal.Dr Zoë Randle, a senior surveys officer at Butterfly Conservation, said: “What we’re really concerned about is the survival rates of caterpillars from last summer. Small tortoiseshells have had a dreadful year so far, as have peacock butterflies, and the whites are doing quite poorly as well.“We want people to take part in the count to generate really important data so we can get a handle on how last summer’s drought affected butterfly species.”There are fears that grass-feeding species have been struck particularly severely by last summer’s heatwave, which turned the grass brown in meadows, fields and parks. Many experts are reporting lower numbers of ringlets than usual, but apparently good numbers of meadow browns and marbled whites have emerged earlier than normal. The Big Butterfly Count will help establish whether or not these species are bouncing back.Randle said that after the 1976 drought it took many of these widespread butterfly species a decade to recover their numbers.With many butterfly species in Britain at the northern edge of their European range, a warming climate should boost their numbers, but data shows that 80% of Britain’s 59 species are declining in either abundance or distribution, with butterflies vanishing from half the places where they once flew since 1976.Last year’s Big Butterfly Count produced the lowest abundance of butterflies in the 13 years of the popular survey. Conservationists attribute these declines to a combination of habitat loss, industrial farming and climatic changes.",

Fish, plants, native crayfish and birds may take years to make a gradual return to previous populations.Speaking after the verdict, Emma Johnson, the area manager for Natural England, said: “The destruction of this section of the River Lugg was devastating for the abundance and range of species which thrived in this river.",

        "text": "In April, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, suggested that severe drought would become “one of the central political and territorial debates of our country in the coming years”. That stark warning surely applies to southern Europe as a whole, as the prospect of another summer crisis looms, following a disastrously dry winter.An absence of melting snow from the Alps has left Italy’s Po River as shallow as during last year’s searingly hot summer. In January and February, France recorded the highest number of rain-free days since records began, and water restrictions are in place in the Pyrénées-Orientales region. About 90% of mainland Portugal is suffering from drought, judged to be severe in one-fifth of the country. In Spain, from Catalonia to Andalucía, unseasonable heat has contributed to reservoirs drying up and a disastrous drop in olive oil production. By the middle of this month, southern Spain had received barely 30% of expected rainfall. As temperatures continue to rise, and Europe warms faster than the global average, drought across vast swathes of territory is simply becoming the norm.There are obvious moves that can be made to alleviate water shortages. A quarter of drinking water in Europe is lost because of leaky pipelines. In Italy – one of the worst offenders in this respect – a drought taskforce has been created to improve water infrastructure. In France, Emmanuel Macron has set a 10% water savings target for all sectors of the economy by 2030 and demanded far greater reuse of wastewater. New, low-energy desalination techniques will be key to guaranteeing future supplies of water for human consumption.There is, however, no foreseeable technical fix that will allow difficult decisions over an increasingly scarce resource to be evaded. The politics of a new, parched reality will be fraught and contested, particularly in relation to food production in transformed terrain. In France, plans for new reservoirs to irrigate farmland have led to violent clashes between police and environmental protesters, who argue that agricultural practices need to become less water-intensive.In Andalucía, regional proposals to legalise irrigation in part of the Doñana Natural Space – one the world’s most important wetlands – have become a wedge issue ahead of local elections this weekend.",

Little is known, however, about what was happening further down the food chain.Now, a British palaeontologist believes he may have found fossilised phytoplankton – forerunners of the tiny but vital algae that today suck masses of carbon out of the atmosphere and produce about half the oxygen we breathe. The fossils, dating back to the Cambrian period – 538m to 485m years ago – are microscopic, roughly the width of a human hair, and lived in the ocean back when there was no life on land.Tom Harvey, from Leicester University, discovered them in rocks he had collected from a logging trail in Newfoundland, Canada, which he was examining using a microscope to search for animal skin. Instead, he came across a cluster of spiny objects stuck together in neat geometric clusters.They were unlike anything he’d seen before. “The cells were quite big, they formed quite a large colony that has this amazing geometry,” he says. They reminded him of the pattern of butterfly eggs laid on a cabbage leaf, but he had no idea what he was looking at. “It was just too mysterious,” Harvey says. “I didn’t even want to hazard a guess.”A quarry in Newfoundland, Canada, where the fossils were found. Photograph: University of LeicesterIt was years before he found more of these microfossils. The process involves dissolving rocks in powerful acid, leaving carbon-based fossils intact, floating in a watery residue. Harvey then uses a microscope to search each drop of liquid, and suck up individual clusters of cells with an eyedropper. Eventually, he had a collection of a few dozen similar-looking fossils.Childhood memories were stirred of pond dipping and examining pond water under a microscope, giving Harvey the idea that his new fossils – although found on land – could be phytoplankton.The discovery is published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B , which describes fossils shaped like little flat plates and rings, just one cell thick; the closest match Harvey could find today are algae that live in ponds and lakes.",

Armada Way, the pedestrianised boulevard that runs south through the city centre to the sea, is a rare postwar conservation area and ought to be a national showpiece. Instead, ugly images of debris strewn among the modern architecture have upset and angered local people and conservationists. They may also set back efforts to boost the city by attracting tourists.The upset and anger are more than justified by events. A consultation regarding the proposed regeneration of the city centre showed that a majority of locals do not support it. A campaign group, Save the Trees of Armada Way (Straw), gathered a petition of more than 16,000 names. Yet the council ploughed on until it was served with a court injunction by campaigners. On Monday, Mr Bingley resigned, ahead of a council meeting.But the chainsaws were not the work of one man. The whole administration stands discredited ahead of May’s local elections. Even the two local Conservative MPs, Johnny Mercer and Sir Gary Streeter, believe that Labour should now take over the council (so far Labour’s Tudor Evans has resisted this, saying that the decision should be made at the ballot box). The infighting and incompetence of local Tories lie behind this declaration of no confidence. Last year, one former councillor, David Downie, said that he was “very concerned” about the Conservative cabinet’s lack of experience. Mr Bingley is on record as having said that people shouldn’t “worry too much about climate change”.Such cavalier attitudes are outdated. It is a sign of progress that so many people now recognise the importance of trees, not only as attractive local features but as wildlife habitats with a role in sequestering carbon and keeping streets cool. Developments for new housing or other infrastructure should work around them. Promises to plant new trees are no substitute for looking after those that already exist.",

They said the only way to protect water supplies was by redistributing water resources more equally.The study used Cape Town in South Africa as a case study and found the richest people used 50 times more water than the poorest. When the Day Zero water crisis struck the city in 2018, after several years of drought, the poorest were left without enough water for their basic needs, the scientists said.Cape Town was far from unique, the researchers said, with similar problems in many cities around the world. Since 2000, more than 80 big cities had experienced extreme drought and water shortages, they said, including Miami, Melbourne, London, Barcelona, São Paulo, Beijing, Bengaluru and Harare.The researchers said urban water crises were expected to become more frequent, with more than 1 billion city dwellers expected to experience water shortages in the near future. In March, a report by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water concluded that the world faces an imminent water crisis, with demand expected to outstrip supply by 40% by 2030.Prof Hannah Cloke, at the University of Reading, UK, and co-author of the new study, said: “Climate change and population growth mean that water is becoming a more precious resource in big cities, but we have shown that social inequality is the biggest problem for poorer people getting access to water for their everyday needs.“Our projections show this crisis could get worse as the gap between the rich and the poor widens in many parts of the world. Ultimately, everyone will suffer the consequences unless we develop fairer ways to share water in cities.",

She has travelled all over India on birding trips and has, she says, spotted 1,060 of the 1,400 bird species in the country.But it was at home, during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, that she saw an Indian silverbill caught in the protective netting on her balcony, attracting the attention of her cat. Although the bird escaped, some of its feathers were damaged. When Munshi saw the exquisite markings and patterns, she tried to identify the bird, but was struck by how little information there was online.“Though India is rich in bird life, there is very little data on bird species and their feathers,” she says. “There are collections of birds from before 1970, but after the passing of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, ‘round skin’ specimens [the traditional method of preserving dead birds] are not allowed, even for scientific research. Those that are in museums, once the wings are folded and dried up, you cannot see the details of individual feathers.” Feathers from a red-necked falcon In November 2021, Munshi teamed up with Sherwin Everett, a vet and curator at an avian hospital in Ahmedabad, to launch the Feather Library website recording the details and images of bird feathers. The hospital treats about 2,000 birds a month. Many have been injured in road accidents and collisions, or during kite festivals, when they get caught in the kite strings. While many recover, some die of their injuries.“Most rescue centres throw away the dead birds or burn them, and a lot of valuable data is lost,” Munshi says. “By collecting these feathers and documenting them digitally, we have a non-invasive way of getting valuable data. Our vision behind creating the feather library was to display the individual feathers of bird species and their markings, patterns, etc so that in the eventuality of their extinction there is a record for future generations.”FeatherLibrary.com is the first online collection of its kind in India. It includes details such as the bird’s weight, body length, beak width, wingspan and number of feathers, as well as where the bird was found.",

But the far-right ex-president’s latest suspected environmental offence reportedly occurred in the waters off Brazil’s south-eastern coastline near the town of São Sebastião.It was there in June that a man resembling Bolsonaro was seemingly spotted – and filmed – about 15 metres from a humpback whale that had surfaced.“The man, thought to be Bolsonaro, was shooting a video with a mobile phone as the whale performed aerial behaviours suggesting distress or discomfort,” the news website iG reported.Brazilian legislation outlaws “the deliberate harassment of any species of cetacean” such as dolphins or humpback whales, which are called baleias jubarte in the South American country.According to rules enforced by the environmental agency Ibama, vessels with their engines running must not come within 100 metres of such animals. Seafarers are also forbidden from chasing or invading the space of pods of dolphins or whales, or making “excessive noise – such as music, any kind of percussion or other [sounds] … within 300 metres of any cetacean”.Another rightwing politician was recently fined 2,500 reais (£410) for committing a similar offence in the same region. Just over a decade ago, Bolsonaro himself was fined for illegal fishing within a marine reserve off the Rio de Janeiro coastline.

Populations of bees, spiders, ground beetles and hoverflies have disappeared twice as fast in areas intensely farmed for crops, according to the paper, which looked at citizen science data on more than 1,500 invertebrate species.Although there was a push to intensify agriculture after the second world war, since the early 90s more sustainable and wildlife-friendly farming practices have emerged, with EU agri-environment funding made available for farmers to plant hedgerows and wild flowers, alongside better regulation of pesticides. However, these have not managed to stem biodiversity loss.“In fact, for most of the taxonomic groups included in this study, declines appear to have accelerated over recent years,” the researchers write in the paper Invertebrate Biodiversity Continues to Decline in Cropland, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.The study suggests that, despite having impact locally, wildlife-friendly farming measures have not been employed on a big enough scale to have an impact nationally. However, the scientists believe that post-Brexit changes to UK agricultural policy could help farming to achieve those goals.Lead researcher Francesca Mancini, from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: “The main message to policymakers is that despite the efforts we have put in in the last 30 years, this is just not enough. We really need to review what we’ve done and try to do better for the future for diversity, but also for the future of agriculture.”Insects are crucial to ecosystems because they provide food for other creatures, pollinate crops and recycle nutrients.The study compared areas in Britain with high and low cropland cover and found that declines are worse in areas with high cropland cover. The researchers divided Britain into 1 sq km cells that were categorised depending on how much cropland – predominantly oilseed rape and cereals such as barley – was being grown within them. They did not look at land used to graze animals.Intensive farming provides little habitat for wildlife; insect populations declined the most in areas with high cropland cover.",

The campaigners argue that the planning committee that granted permission for the drilling erred because it only accounted for emissions arising from the drilling site itself, rather than those from the oils’ end use, when it is burned and most of the emissions produced.She has already lost in the high court and the court of appeal. On Wednesday morning, five supreme court justices, Lord Kitchin, Lord Sales, Lord Leggatt, Lady Rose, and Lord Richards, began hearing the case.Shell drops target to cut oil production as CEO aims for higher profitsRead moreA victory would have serious implications for future plans for oil and gas wells and coalmines in the UK, forcing planners to take into account the total emissions from any fossil fuels extracted, rather than merely the emissions from the extraction.Ahead of the case, Finch said: “The biggest climate impact from fossil fuel projects occurs when the fuel they produce is eventually burned.“It’s unbelievable that these ‘downstream’ GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions are ignored when planning decisions are made. I hope that the supreme court will give a clear ruling and end the dangerous lack of clarity on this point.”The proposed expansion of the Horse Hill site would include five drilling cellars, four hydrocarbon production wells, four gas-to-power generators, a process, storage and tanker loading area, seven 1,300-barrel oil tanks, and a 37-metre drill rig. Altogether, they would allow for the large-scale production of up to 3.3m tonnes of crude oil, for sale and use as transport fuel for the next 20 years.“It’s difficult to overstate the importance of this case,” said Rowan Smith, a solicitor with Leigh Day, who is representing Finch.",

Companies have sued over phasing out coal-fired power stations, ending offshore oil drilling and banning fracking, with some receiving large taxpayer-funded payouts.Critics of the ECT include the European Union, which says staying in the treaty would “clearly undermine” climate targets. France, Germany, Spain and eight other countries have already said they will leave and the EU is also set to pull out en masse. The UK and Japan are the only major economies not to have committed to exiting the ECT.The UK has been a “strong advocate” of reforming the treaty but the intention to leave it by numerous countries has created an impasse. Stuart said that if the reforms were not passed by November, the UK would consider withdrawal.“Rather than being stuck indefinitely with an outdated treaty, the UK wants to see an agreement on a modernised treaty as quickly as possible,” Stuart said. “In its current form, the ECT will not support those countries looking to make the transition to cleaner, cheaper energy sources and could even penalise our country for being at the forefront of those efforts.”Cleodie Rickard, trade campaign manager at Global Justice Now, said: “It is welcome to hear the UK is finally willing to review its membership of the climate-wrecking ECT. But putting off the decision until November looks like an attempt to keep the UK sitting on the fence.”“The reform process to this treaty has failed,” she said. “Eleven countries are voting with their feet and exiting, meaning there is not enough support to get the so-called modernisation through. Rather than more dither and delay, the UK should be joining a co-ordinated withdrawal now to maximise the benefits of leaving this damaging deal.”The UK’s official advisers, the Climate Change Committee, said in July that the UK should quit the ECT because “continued membership represents risks to both a timely climate transition and to the taxpayer”.",

Yet, in the most productive parts of the archipelago, reindeer populations have flourished in recent decades.Two Svalbard reindeer battle for control of a harem.

By comparing the proportion of carbon and nitrogen isotopes in these samples, they could infer what kinds of plants the reindeer had been eating in preceding weeks.The research, published in Global Change Biology, suggested that between 1995 and 2012 – a period marked by the normalisation of rain-on-snow events, increased summer temperatures and a growing reindeer population – there was a dietary shift away from low-growing mosses and towards grass-like “graminoid” plants.“The erect nature of the graminoid stems allows that forage to be available to the animals, even though you might have a centimetre or so of ice,” said Prof Jeffrey Welker at the University of Oulu, who supervised the research. “You have the equivalent of popsicle sticks, which are nutritious enough that those animals can sustain themselves, even during these stressful periods of winter.",

An estimated one million waterbirds die of lead poisoning in the EU every year.Under the ban adopted by the European Commission from 16 February, shooters will have to use non-toxic ammunition such as steel, bismuth or other non-toxic metals in or within 100 metres of wetlands.The move has been welcomed by campaigners. “This is huge,” said Barbara Herrero, senior EU nature policy officer at BirdLife Europe. “Despite banning lead from paint, pencils and virtually everything else several decades ago, it was still allowed to poison our shared environment – even when alternatives exist.“With this ban, the EU has addressed a significant part of the problem. We now call on EU countries to make sure the ban is enforced.”In the EU, 44,000 tonnes of lead ends up in the environment every year; 57% from sports shooting, 32% from hunting, and 11% from fishing.Waterbirds are believed to eat the shot, mistaking it for food or grit, which they need to help digest food. Scavengers and predatory birds are poisoned by eating lead shot in their prey. Birds that have ingested lead are often weakened due to the release of dangerous toxins and are more likely to be targeted by predators, which in turn spreads the contamination through the ecosystem.“It’s such a huge milestone,” said Dr Julia Newth, from the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT). “Lead shot has been contaminating wetlands for more than a century; finally, this law is coming into force. It’s something to be celebrated, but there is more work to be done, with wider restrictions currently being considered in the European Union.”A shotgun loaded with cartridges, ready for the hunt. Photograph: Pascal Pochard-Casabianca/AFP/GettyThe UK, where up to 100,000 waterbirds die of lead poisoning each year, is considering introducing wider restrictions on lead ammunition across all habitats, with a decision pushed back to next year.Newth supports a complete ban on lead ammunition in all British habitats.",

Meanwhile, Europe is experiencing its warmest January days on record and communities around the world are grappling with extreme weather events supercharged by the climate crisis.”Graphic showing the lengths of private jet flights to the 2022 World Economic Forum meetingOf the flights to airports near Davos last year, 53% were short-haul flights of less than 750km (466 miles), which could have been done by rail or car, while 38% were over distances of less than 500km. The shortest flight recorded was just 13 miles.The 2023 WEF meeting has a self-proclaimed goal of tackling the climate emergency and other “ongoing crises”, and has called for “bold collective action”. Private jet flights are not regulated in the EU, but they are the most polluting mode of transport per passenger kilometre.Schenk urged leaders not to travel by private jet this year and to ban their use in general. “Given that 80% of the world’s population has never even flown, but suffers from the consequences of climate-damaging aviation emissions, and that the WEF claims to be committed to the 1.",

The Zoological Society of London, which I head, received a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to repurpose our Snowdon Aviary in London Zoo into an enclosure for colobus monkeys. This grant also enabled us to offer 100,000 heavily discounted tickets to community groups. We extended this so that anyone on benefits could buy a ticket for £3, which is a tenth of the cost of peak-season entry for an adult.News of the £3 offer spread fast, and on the first day of February half-term it became clear that something extraordinary was happening. Literally thousands of families were descending on our zoos. Both London and Whipsnade had twice as many visitors as we had been expecting.As I surveyed the queue, stretching around the edge of Regent’s Park as far as I could see, I had mixed feelings. One part of me was horrified that our visitors were having to wait so long to get in. But another saw a physical expression of something powerful and good that has changed our zoos overnight. The queues marked the moment when our conservation zoos opened to all, including those who could not have previously afforded to visit.We worked quickly to bring the situation under more control. We moved to online booking only. We set up separate queues for our members. We brought in more staff, and put a cap on the numbers in both zoos, so we could ensure all our visitors had a positive experience.And the experience has been an overwhelmingly positive one. In half-term week alone, we had 133,000 visitors to our zoos, more than 50,000 of them on £3 tickets. Dozens of those families told us how much it meant to them to be there. Our staff are visibly energised by what’s happened, if exhausted by the unexpected numbers.I saw toddlers grinning with delight when a penguin swam over to investigate the bright colours of their winter coats.

It is seen as leading a new form of more radical climate action in Europe with high-profile direct action often aimed at big business interests, state projects and large-scale farming.The group was part of a demonstration over a controversial irrigation project in Sainte-Soline, western France, in March that led to fierce clashes with police. Around 5,000 protesters battled with more than 3,000 police officers. Two protesters were left in a coma afterwards, while around 30 officers were injured.The demonstrators were protesting against a giant reservoir for storing water pumped up from the underground water table, saying it would hurt smaller farmers and the ecosystem, while benefiting mainly industrial agriculture groups.France’s Human Rights League said after the protests that “as soon as the demonstrators arrived at the reservoir site, police fired at them with weapons of war: teargas grenades, stun grenades, explosive sting-ball grenades and rubber bullets … the deployment put everyone present at risk of serious harm”.Earlier this month, UN experts urged France to review its policing practices, expressing concern at the “reported excessive use of force” against protesters, in particular at Sainte-Soline.This month Les Soulèvements de la Terre led protests against a sand quarry in western France where protesters tore up fields and equipment at a farm. The group was also one of several organisers of a banned demonstration at the weekend against a new rail link between the eastern city of Lyon and Turin in Italy.On Tuesday, prosecutors said they detained 14 people for questioning over vandalism at an earlier protest supported by Les Soulèvements de la Terre, against a Lafarge cement plant near the southern city of Marseille.The interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, confirmed in parliament on Tuesday that the group would be shut down, saying “no cause justifies the injuring of police officers and gendarmes”.The government spokesman, Olivier Véran, accused the coalition of encouraging violence at the Sainte-Soline irrigation protest in March.",

Photograph: Vicky NallThe plants had been absent from the lowland raised peat bog for a century after it was drained to be managed for game bird shooting.The region has lost 98% of its lowland peatland, much of it converted to farmland, causing the peat to desiccate and release large quantities of carbon dioxide.Over the last decade, however, Winmarleigh has been restored by the trust to support rare wildlife and sequester carbon. Peat banks hold water on the site, allowing bog cranberry and spongy sphagnum moss to regrow and fauna including the common lizard and the large heath butterfly to flourish.With £30,000 of funding from the Lancashire Environmental Fund, Whitecroft Lighting and Natural England, the trust has brought back missing plant species, including the sundews, alongside bog asphodel and white beak-sedge.The delicate white flowers of white beak-sedge are a vital nectar source for the rare large heath, whose fortunes had declined with the widespread draining of wetland.The restoration should aid large heath butterflies, whose population had dwindled after the draining of peatland.

All of them were fertilised and showed some sign of embryo development but at least half of them had flaky, brittle or crumbly thin fragile shells. We have this hint there could be a problem here. It’s worth noting that those eggs with particularly thin shells had embryos that died in particularly late development.”This finding worried her, so she asked the partnership to get samples from across the UK to see if it was widespread and whether there was any pattern with regard to egg quality and hatching success.Nest monitors have been asked to send failed eggs and egg fragments to Hemmings, who will be analysing them to find out why they are becoming so crumbly. “We want to assess what degree this is a threat to the recovery of the curlew,” she said, adding: “The first step is to find out if this issue is widespread, then the next step will be to try to identify what the problem is, so what’s causing the problem with these eggshells. We will analyse eggshell samples to look for environmental contaminants that might be leading to poor eggshell quality and also look for evidence of poor nutrition.",

The Tate, National Portrait Gallery, Royal Shakespeare Company, Scottish Ballet and Royal Opera House have all ended funding partnerships of many decades with the energy giant in recent years.Among major national museums and arts companies, only the Science Museum is still supported by BP, which funds its educational academy.BP has been a sponsor of the British Museum since 1996. On paper, the most recent five-year contract between the two expired in February, but the British Museum and BP have repeatedly resisted being explicit that their partnership was over, leading to concerns of an ongoing relationship behind the scenes.Campaigners feared the oil giant could be lined up as a potential funder for the radical £1bn rebuilding scheme currently being planned by the museum.In the new disclosures, obtained by lawyers acting for the campaign group Culture Unstained, the museum said that “certain terms” of the deal remain in effect, because it has verbally agreed to let BP exercise its “supporter benefits” until the end of 2023.It will not specify the supporter benefits, but these are likely to include hospitality privileges, such as use of the museum’s spaces for corporate entertaining.

That is equivalent to 7% of global GDP and almost double what the world spends on education. Countries have pledged to phase out subsidies for years to ensure the price of fossil fuels reflects their true environmental costs, but have achieved little to date.Explicit subsidies, which cut the price of fuels for consumers, doubled in 2022 as countries responded to the higher energy prices resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Rich households benefited far more from these than poor ones, the IMF said. Implicit subsidies, which represent the “enormous” costs of the damage caused by fossil fuels through climate change and air pollution, made up 80% of the total.Ending the subsidies should be the centrepiece of climate action, the IMF said, and would put the world on track to restrict global heating to below 2C, as well as preventing 1.6 million air pollution deaths a year and increasing government revenues by trillions of dollars. The researchers acknowledged that subsidy reform was politically difficult, but said carefully designed policies that supported poorer households could work, especially if coordinated internationally.The IMF’s findings come as the climate crisis wreaks havoc across the world, from heatwaves, wildfires and floods from the Americas to Europe to Asia.Cutting fossil fuel subsidies “needs to be the centrepiece of efforts over the next few years to get on track with limiting global warming to below 2C”, said Ian Parry of the IMF. “Ideally this is done through carbon pricing [and] some of the revenues from reforms should be used to compensate poor and vulnerable households.“We are in this situation because it can be very difficult to increase taxes on fossil fuels, not least when countries are acting unilaterally,” he said. “We recommend that large emitting countries coordinate on carbon pricing or similar policies to help scale up global action.",

But while seabird cases were confirmed, the seal infections were classed as suspected, pending lab results.The first known cases of H5N1 were detected in the Antarctic region in October among brown skua on Bird Island, off South Georgia. Two months later, hundreds of elephant seals were found dead. There have also been increased deaths of fur seals, kelp gulls and brown skua at several other sites.Marco Falchieri, a scientist in the UK Animal and Plant Health Agency’s (APHA) influenza and avian virology team, which collected the South Georgia samples that tested positive for bird flu. He said he saw about 20 dead elephant seals. “Emotionally it is almost heartbreaking to see so many dead seals.”Other seals were showing respiratory signs of bird flu, he said, citing “coughs, sneezing, ocular discharge, nasal discharge, slow head shaking and tremors”.Falchieri said the death toll on South Georgia was probably about 100, mainly elephant seals, who appear to be more affected than fur seals.“My worst fear is an adaptive mutation to mammals, which we are not seeing in these new samples, but we need to keep monitoring,” he said. An adaptive mutation, he added, “could mean it becomes a mammalian-adapted virus, and consequently increases risk for humans too”.The spillover to the South Georgia mammals is “a reflection of what’s going on globally”, said Ashley Banyard, an APHA virologist. Banyard’s team diagnosed the samples brought back from the island in mid-December.Spillovers occurred, Banyard said, “when too many birds have bird flu [and] mammals come into close contact with sick birds’ poo or when the mammals eat [an] infected bird carcass”.",

But hybrid workers did not reduce their emissions so dramatically, according to the research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.One day of remote work a week reduced emissions by just 2% because energy savings from not being in the office were offset by factors such as an increase in non-commuting travel when working from home. Working remotely two or four days a week reduced an individual’s emissions by up to 29% compared with on-site workers.‘Never again’: is Britain finally ready to return to the office?Read moreResearchers from Cornell University and Microsoft used multiple datasets including Microsoft’s own employee data on commuting and teleworking behaviours to model the predicted greenhouse gas emissions of office workers, remote workers and hybrid workers in the US, examining five categories of emissions including office and residential energy use.They found that IT and communications technology had a negligible impact on individuals’ work carbon footprints.The main causes of remote workers’ reduced emissions were less office energy use, as well as fewer emissions from a daily commute.Wider emissions reducing benefits of working from home include the easing of vehicle congestion during rush hour in commuting areas, which is likely to improve fuel economy.

Used by scientists and weather forecasters, it is less well known to the wider public.Medicanes, which tend to form over parts of the Mediterranean Sea near the north African coast, are similar to hurricanes and typhoons although they can develop over cooler waters.Destruction of Derna: why was flooding so bad in Libyan port city?Read moreThey can also bear a physical resemblance on satellite imagery as a swirling mass of storm clouds surrounding an eye in the middle.Fierce winds and rain are unleashed; Storm Daniel dumped approximately 170 millimetres of rain in Libya. This will intensify with global warming, scientists say.“We are confident that climate change is supercharging the rainfall associated with such storms,” said University of Reading professor Liz Stephens.The Mediterranean cyclones are usually smaller and weaker than their tropical equivalents and have a smaller space in which to develop.Their peak strength is usually the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, encompassing speeds of 119-153km (74-95 miles) per hour.Medicanes tend to form in the autumn when the sea is warm, usually in the western Mediterranean and the region between the Ionian Sea and the north African coast, explained Suzanne Gray, a professor at the University of Reading’s meteorology department.A layer of colder air from higher altitudes forms convections with warmer air rising from the sea that converge around a centre of low pressure.Medicanes form once or twice per year on average, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Before striking Libya, Daniel pummelled Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey last week.Three medicanes occurred off Greece between 2016 and 2018, while in 2019 Spanish weather services identified one between the Balearic Islands and the Algerian coast.A medicane packing winds of up to 120 kilometres per hour, dubbed Ianos, lashed Greece in September 2020, killing three people in the city of Karditsa and triggering floods, landslides and power cuts.The Italian island of Sicily was also struck in 2021.",

Lead author, Dr Eleanor Tew, head of forest planning at Forestry England and visiting researcher at the University of Cambridge, described the finding as “sobering and alarming”.Many of the threats warned of by researchers are already affecting forests and woodlands. The fungal disease ash dieback will kill up to eight out of 10 of the UK’s ash trees. In 2021, winter storms destroyed about 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres) of forest in Britain. Climate projections show storms, heatwaves, droughts and floods are likely to become more common and more severe.“The problem comes when you get all of those things happening at the same time as multiple, interrelated threats,” said Tew. “That just overwhelms the forest, and you basically get trees dying and the forest ecosystem collapsing … that has massive landscape impacts, and significant impacts for society.”A wildfire on the Clwydian Range moorland in Llangollen, Wales, June 2021. Photograph: Getty ImagesCatastrophic ecosystem collapse is not inevitable, and is not yet occurring in the UK’s forests. “We do have time to make a difference, and there is a lot we can do to make our forests more resilient,” said Tew, who described the paper as a “call for action”.Solutions include increasing the diversity of tree species within a wood, planting trees of different ages, promoting natural regeneration and managing deer populations. People can help by using the online Tree Alert tool to report possible tree pests and diseases. Tew also said people should make sure their boots are clean before walking in a new woodland to avoid spreading disease.The long-term impacts of forest ecosystem collapse would include loss of timber, carbon sequestration, poorer air quality, water retention and human enjoyment. In some parts of Europe, there has already been ecosystem collapse within forests: storms, drought and bark beetle outbreaks in Germany have destroyed the equivalent of 250,000 football fields of forest.",

BP has never appointed a boss from outside, and Murray Auchincloss, the former chief financial officer, fits the bill as a continuity candidate. He has been in the company for 25 years and is wedded to Looney’s – and chair Helge Lund’s – strategy of “orderly” transition to net zero by 2050 or sooner. He did the numbers on the approach, after all.Continuity won’t be everybody’s cup of tea, however. Some investors will hate it. They are the ones who don’t sign climate activist resolutions and don’t buy the idea that BP’s “transition growth engines” – wind turbines, hydrogen, biofuels and electric vehicle (EV) charging points – can ever generate the same returns on capital as fossil fuels. They would rather oil companies stick to producing oil and gas (and ramping up the dividends and share buybacks) while leaving the transitioning stuff to specialists.On Looney’s watch, BP’s shares persistently traded at a discount within the Big Oil club. In a post-Covid world of higher oil prices, the very oily and cash-generative Americans, Chevron and Exxon, sit atop the valuation charts. Versus Shell, which last year abandoned plans to cut oil production each year for the rest of the decade, BP also stands at a discount. Looney’s own tweak was to lower BP’s target for a cut in hydrocarbon production from 40% to 25% by 2030, but it didn’t close the valuation gap.What is Auchincloss to do? Well, one hopes he does what he says and sticks to the plan. Somebody within oil’s old guard has to try to demonstrate that it is possible to generate the same returns in energy outside fossil fuels. BP’s pledge is that biofuels (gas and liquid) and EV charging points can produce an oil-like 15% over the cycle. If that was achieved, some of the doubts would fade.Half the problem, though, is long lead times.",

This was mainly based on more than 20 years of research in particle pollution and lung cancer.The number of research studies has almost doubled since the IARC meeting in Lyon, with even more evidence on lung cancer in never-smokers, but governmental action to reduce air pollution has not kept up.Globally, outdoor air pollution is second only to tobacco as the greatest cause of lung and respiratory cancers. This holds true in almost all parts of the world, with a notable exception of low-income countries where people (especially women and children) also breathe smoke in their homes from cooking on open fires.In the past 10 years new studies have linked air pollution to other cancers, including breast and bladder cancer. These have also been associated with nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant from diesel traffic that is being targeted by low emissions zones in many cities. There is emerging evidence of links to childhood leukaemia too.For those people with lung cancer, smokers and never-smokers, their prognosis and survival appears to be reduced if they live in a polluted area. Research includes a recent study of more than a quarter of a million people with lung cancer in Pennsylvania. This raises questions about the impact of air pollution on the way that cancer progresses and how it may change the effectiveness of chemotherapy.In 2020, Dr Michelle Turner of ISGlobal, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, led a review of evidence on cancer and air pollution. She said: “Actions to reduce outdoor air pollution will reduce lung cancer in both smokers and in non-smokers. They may also improve survival from lung cancer, especially in those diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease. A study from the UK’s Francis Crick Institute found that living for three years in an area of higher particle pollution might be sufficient to promote growth of EGFR-driven lung cancer, a type of cancer common in never- and light-smokers.",

And it should trigger them to act.”The WMO report, timed to inform the negotiations at Cop28, said climate records had been shattered in 2023, leaving “a trail of devastation and despair”.Data up to the end of October showed 2023 was about 1.4C (2.5F) above pre-industrial levels, driven by the continued rise in carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning and by the return of the El Niño climate pattern. The latter is likely to make 2024 another record year, and bring the internationally agreed limit of 1.5C (2.7F) ever nearer.“Greenhouse gas levels are record high. Global temperatures are record high. Sea level rise is record high. Antarctic sea ice is record low. It’s a deafening cacophony of broken records,” said the WMO secretary-general, Prof Petteri Taalas.“These are more than just statistics,” he said. “Extreme weather is destroying lives and livelihoods on a daily basis – underlining the imperative need to ensure that everyone is protected by early warning services. We cannot return to the climate of the 20th century, but we must act now to limit the risks of an increasingly inhospitable climate in this and coming centuries.”Rising sea levels chartTemperature records have been called “gobsmackingly bananas” this year. June, July, August, September and October 2023 all smashed previous records for those months, the WMO said.Particularly startling has been the crash in the Antarctic sea ice extent. The maximum end-of-winter extent in 2023 was the lowest on record by far, 1m km2 less than the previous record low, an area bigger than France and Germany combined.The WMO said extreme weather had a big impact on all continents.

An enormous clump of seaweed circulating the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic is set to coat beaches in a spongy goop, bringing with it a pungent odor similar to rotting eggs.The creeping threat of the Great Atlantic Sargassum BeltRead moreThe huge mass of sargassum is the latest in a series of massive blooms scientists have noticed in the Atlantic since 2011 but could be the largest yet. It is pushing west through the Caribbean and beaches in Cancún, Mexico, and Key West, Florida, have already seen large mats wash ashore.The brown morass has doubled in size every month from November to January, forming a belt wider than the continental US. It is expected to hit beaches elsewhere in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico this summer, potentially causing problems for tourists.The seaweed is a floating type of algae that has berry-like bubbles filled with oxygen that keep it buoyant. When it reaches shore, it decays in the sun and releases hydrogen sulfide, which smells like rotten eggs and can aggravate respiratory problems such as asthma.“It smells very bad and chases away tourists,” said Chuanmin Hu, an oceanographer at the University of South Florida who tracks the sargassum blooms via satellite.Sargassum has always naturally formed in the Atlantic and, out at sea, provides a huge floating habitat for animals such as turtles, birds, crabs and shrimp. Some animals, like the sargassum fish, live their whole lives in the floating brown armada. The seaweed also soaks up carbon dioxide.However, sargassum can pose problems once it has washed ashore and scientists have noticed a large increase over the last decades in the amount now routinely clogging up shorelines in piles five or six feet deep.In Barbados, authorities deploy hundreds of dump trucks to clear the beaches for tourist season. Last year, the US Virgin Islands declared a state of emergency after being inundated by sargassum.",

I am a climate researcher and since March 2023, I have been completing vital fieldwork into the social impact of climate change almost 15,000 miles away by overland routes, on the island of Bougainville off the coast of Papua New Guinea.My fieldwork had been mired in unforeseeable problems, from natural disasters to security threats, and my employer was, unsurprisingly, unhappy that my return had been delayed by many weeks. The urgency of their request to return meant I would have to jump on a plane if I was to meet the deadline; but for me, this was not an option. I have been practising conscientious objection to flying for more than 10 years. My employer has supported me on a “slow trip” in the past. I do not boycott flying altogether, but I will only catch a plane when no other alternative exists.This weekend, I will set sail on a cargo ship to return to Germany, travelling to East New Britain in Papua New Guinea. From there, I will cover the remaining distance to Europe by cargo ship, ferry, train and coach.Many people have asked why it is so important for me to travel as low-carbon as possible. I have three reasons. First, I want to be consistent with my moral commitment to avoid flying. Aviation is the biggest contributor to climate change of all forms of transport, a major factor in the rise in temperatures and the extreme weather events that we are witnessing more and more frequently all around the world.A trip by plane from Papua New Guinea to Germany produces, in 32 hours, 5.3 tonnes of CO2 per passenger.

The mess caused by sharing an old church with a colony of bats – which have formed nationally significant roosts in the buildings – has threatened some churches with closure, as droppings and urine built up, damaging artefacts that had survived Henry VIII and the English Reformation.Thornham is one of more than 100 historic churches in England that have received support from the £5m Bats in Churches scheme, which was launched in 2019 to help resolve the growing problem of human-wildlife conflict caused by bat damage.“If they’re not a happy church, the first thing you’ll hear is: ‘We don’t like the bats, we want rid of the bats,’” says Spencer. “But actually, once you start talking to them, it’s not the bats; it’s the mess, it’s the urine, it’s that they’re causing damage to something. When they try and do a tea and coffee morning, as soon as the drinks come out, there is bat mess in them.

In 2022 the government approved a record-breaking 106 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired power capacity. One gigawatt is the equivalent of a large coal power plant.This run of approvals is continuing, potentially on track to break last year’s record, according to analysis by the Global Energy Monitor (GEM) and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, published on Tuesday.It said in the first half of 2023, authorities granted approvals for 52GW of new coal power, began construction on 37GW of new coal power, announced 41GW-worth of new projects, and revived 8GW of previously shelved projects. It said about half of the plants permitted in 2022 had started construction by summer.The analysts said: “Unless permitting is stopped immediately, China won’t be able to reduce coal-fired power capacity during the 15th five-year plan (2026–30) without subsequent cancellations of already permitted projects or massive early retirement of existing plants.”Analysts have observed big advances in the renewable energy sector in China, which the government intends to make a mainstay of power supply, with coal in a supporting role.China is the world’s largest producer of renewable energy, including wind, solar and hydroelectricity. But previous analyses have found infrastructure to store and distribute has not kept pace.Shortfalls in interconnectivity between regional grids, and issues with power supply for some areas mean energy driven by fossil fuels remains crucial for supporting grid stability or integrating variable renewable energy sources. However, the report says many or most of the approvals being rushed through are not in areas with those issues.“Sixy per cent of new coal power projects are in grid regions where there is already an excess of coal-fired power capacity,” the report says.",

Overall, they said, “important strides forward” had been made towards the protection of the marine environment.It was a crucial, three-week-long meeting of the ISA, a UN-affiliated body, which was under pressure to finalise rules governing mining by this month.The ISA’s 36-member council, the body that oversees rules and regulations, decided it needed more time to finalise rules. Last week, in a decision that effectively delayed the start of any mining operations, it said it would work “with a view” to adopting regulations in 2025. The council did not decide how to consider any application requests that might arrive in the meantime, however, prompting criticism that a legal loophole remained open. In March, the council said exploitation should not be agreed until a mining code was agreed.",

One container held 1,000 25kg sacks of the tiny balls, which are used in the manufacture of plastic products.In the weeks since the spill, millions of the pellets have washed up on beaches in north-west Spain, prompting a clean-up operation by regional workers and volunteers.On Tuesday, the regional governments of Galicia and neighbouring Asturias issued level 2 alerts, which will allow more personnel and resources to be assigned to the task as well as logistical assistance from the Spanish government’s environment and transport ministries.Alfonso Rueda, the regional president of Galicia, said there was still time to stop more pellets washing up on the shoreline. “There are hundreds of sacks right now that have not reached the coast,” he said on Tuesday. “The time to collect them, or at least to try, is now that they are at sea.

Good news for the health of 100,000 people who live in the centre of Bristol – but not everyone is happy.One common objection is that zones only accelerate changes that would happen anyway as old vehicles wear out and are replaced. However, poor air is estimated to cause a health burden of more than 200 early deaths each year in Bristol, 9,600 in London and 32,000 UK-wide.Q&AHow does air pollution affect the human body?ShowAir pollution has been described as the ‘new tobacco’ by the head of the World Health Organization. Over 90% of the world’s population suffers toxic air and research is increasingly revealing the profound impacts on the health of people, especially children.Children and babies’ developing bodies are most at risk from toxic air, with 300 million living in places where toxic fumes are six times above the international guidelines. A comprehensive global review found that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. It causes issues from heart and lung disease to diabetes and dementia, and from liver problems and bladder cancer to brittle bones and damaged skin. The systemic damage is the result of pollutants causing inflammation that then floods through the body, and from ultrafine particles being carried around the body by the bloodstream. A Canadian study recently linked air pollution nanoparticles to brain cancer for first timeIn the UK, while deaths attributed to air pollution have halved in the last four decades, most urban areas have illegal levels of air pollution. One in 20 deaths in the UK is still attributable to small particle pollution alone.Damian Carrington, Environment editorWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.",

The larvae of the flies contain proteins and other nutritious compounds so are being raised for animal feed, and they break down waste so are being bred for that, too. However, adult flies are less useful and are discarded after their short life span. Wooley’s team has been trying to use these carcasses to make useful materials from a waste product.The researchers found that chitin, a sugar-based polymer, is a major component of the flies and it strengthens the shell, or exoskeleton, of insects and crustaceans. Shrimp and crab shells are already used for chitin extraction. Researchers said the fly-sourced chitin powder seemed purer than that from crustaceans and obtaining chitin from flies could avoid concerns over some seafood allergies.From the fly products, the team created a hydrogel that can absorb 47 times its weight in water in just one minute. This product could be used in cropland soil to capture flood water and then slowly release moisture during droughts.Wooley said: “Here in Texas, we’re constantly either in a flood or drought situation, so I’ve been trying to think of how we can make a superabsorbent hydrogel that could address this.”The scientists hope they will soon be able to create bioplastics such as polycarbonates or polyurethanes, which are traditionally made from petrochemicals, from the flies. These plastics will not contribute to the plastic pollution problem.",

Now the RSPB has revealed that thanks to conservation work, the bird, which has a distinctive “booming” call, has had one of its most successful breeding seasons.Last year, the secretive member of the heron family bred successfully for the first time at RSPB Saltholme nature reserve in Teesside – their most northerly breeding record. Although most of the records are in England, with some in Wales, bittern were once found in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and there is hope that they will once again have a presence there.00:00:21The boom of the UK’s loudest bird, the bittern (video by RSPB)Conservationists counted 228 booming males during the last breeding season, one of the most successful years to date. The wetland-dwelling birds depend on reedbed habitats, where they move, camouflaged, to hunt fish, insects and amphibians.The males are easiest to count as you hear them before you see them; they are the loudest bird in the UK with their far-carrying “foghorn” boom being detectable up to three miles away. Men of the species make this noise in spring to attract female mates.Bitterns returned to Norfolk, coming over from the European mainland, in 1900, but after their wetlands were drained for agriculture in the 20th century their population dropped again and fell to just 11 males by 1997.Since then, the restoration of their habitat has caused the species to recover, though it is still amber-listed, meaning it is under threat.Conservationists continue to try to restore their habitat so they can have a secure future in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

There is lots of evidence it causes significant coughing and breathlessness. We’re not seeing lots of highly damaged lungs yet, but there are cases reported where the inflammatory response is overwhelming and causes permanent scarring.”He said that while he thought Australia’s approach, where vapes are only available on prescription, might overburden the NHS, England’s permissive approach was “out of step” with neighbouring countries, such as Scotland, France, Germany and Ireland. So far, England has banned free vape samples for under-18s and may prohibit colourful packaging and flavour names that target younger people.Ministers had the power to “easily” ban disposable vapes, he said, and he hoped they would respond “as fast as possible” to submissions to the government’s call for evidence on youth vaping, which closes on 6 June, to avoid the problem getting kicked into the political long grass before the next general election. “If you’re 12 and starting to vape regularly we can’t wait for that 12-year-old to be 13 or 14, we need action now.",

The signatories include 25 former prime ministers or presidents.Such a levy would shave off only a small fraction of the bonanza that oil-producing countries have made in recent years, and would help to fill a fund for the “loss and damage” to poor countries afflicted by the impacts of the climate crisis.Brown told the Guardian: “The deadlock on climate finance has to be broken if Cop28 is to succeed. After more than a decade of broken promises, a $25bn oil and gas levy paid by the petrol states and proposed by the UAE as chair of Cop would kickstart finance for mitigation [reduction of greenhouse gas emissions] and adaptation in the global south.“But all the main historic and current emitters must come to the table with guarantees and grants if the $1tn a year needed for development and climate funding in the global south is to be raised.”The letter is being sent to the Cop28 president-designate, Sultan Al Jaber, who is also chief executive of Adnoc, the national oil company of the United Arab Emirates, and to the current G20 president, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil.Signatories include the former UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon; the former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark; the former president of Malawi Joyce Banda, and the former president of Chile Michelle Bachelet, as well as scores of leading economists.The letter points out that, according to the International Energy Agency, petroleum revenues were $1.5tn a year pre-Covid but soared to a record $4tn in 2022.",

The charity is calling on UK governments to better manage all stocks and collect more data, with monitoring involving cameras.UK may ban sandeel fishing in move to save threatened seabirdsRead moreCharlotte Coombes, Good Fish Guide manager at the MCS, said: “The north-east Atlantic mackerel population has been declining since 2015, which is concerning. Fishing communities and wildlife depend on this species, but continued overfishing is putting both at risk.”Mackerel is caught by various states, including Norway, Iceland, the UK, and countries in the EU. Currently, these countries are not working together to tackle overfishing of the species, the charity said. Coombes said countries need to agree on quotas “to protect stocks”.In October 2021, the main fishing states again agreed that total mackerel catches in 2022 should not exceed the scientific advice (794,920 tonnes), but not how the catches should be divided. The combined catch limits set by all countries for 2022 totalled 1,131,416 tonnes, exceeding the advice by 42%.During March 2023, countries met to decide how to divide the next set of quotas. However, nothing was decided and talks are continuing.The UK takes about 17% of the total mackerel catch, mostly from Scottish boats. In 2021, more than 220,000 tonnes of mackerel were caught – 32% of the total UK catch – worth about £240m.Mackerel is important prey for whales, dolphins, and tuna, the charity said, adding that removing too much of this species could have wider environmental effects.Only 15 ratings have joined the green-rated “best choice” list this spring. The MCS use a traffic light system – green, red and amber – to show where fish rank, with mackerel moving to the amber list.",

This development is, of course, welcome, if long overdue. But it doesn’t really change anything. Who will ever be able to forget the chainsaws? Beloved limes and sycamores are gone. Most of us will be long dead before their replacements reach anything like maturity.Thinking about this horrible, unnecessary business all over again, I’m struck by the default accusations of nimbyism on the council’s part, an attitude that persists even now. In its statement, it said that it had misrepresented those who protested against the destruction as “primarily interested only in their own streets”.I know this is true; most activists cared about neighbourhoods far beyond their own. But I also wonder why the council believes it might be morally dubious for a person to worry about his or her own street? Isn’t this where community begins? Each street is part of a village – Sheffield is famously a collection of villages – and these villages make up the city.Councils, it seems to me, deploy the word community only when it suits.

This would emit 781m tonnes of carbon dioxide – more than two times the annual carbon emissions of the UK.The figures are based on an analysis of Azerbaijan’s current gas production, plus its reserves approved for development and those that have been assessed by oil and gas companies but have not yet been cleared to develop. They suggest that the country’s annual gas production is likely to rise from an estimated 37bcm this year, to 49bcm a year in 2033.The conservative analysis does not include gas reserves that are understood to be present but have not yet been proven by drilling, which could still be developed within the next 10 years. It also excludes Azerbaijan’s forecast production of gas condensate, which is a liquid form of the hydrocarbon.Last month, Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, said the country was “confidently moving toward the goal” of doubling its gas exports to Europe by 2027.

More than a quarter of the activity of transport and energy vessels is also missing from public tracking systems, it found.While fishing decreased globally by 12% over the study period of 2017-2021 due to the Covid pandemic, the research showed that the number of offshore structures at sea grew rapidly, with wind turbines surpassing the number of oil structures in 2021. China’s offshore wind energy has increased ninefold since 2017, while the biggest offshore wind developers in Europe – the UK and Germany – saw an increase of 49% and 28% respectively.Hundreds of fishing fleets that go ‘dark’ suspected of illegal hunting, study findsRead moreThe analysis of ocean industrialisation reveals hotspots of potential illegal activity, including industrial fishing vessels encroaching on artisanal fishing grounds or other countries’ waters. It shows “dark” fishing vessels inside marine protected areas, including, on average, more than 20 a week in the Great Barrier Reef and five a week in the Galápagos Islands, two of the most well-monitored and biologically important reserves in the world.“A new industrial revolution has been emerging in our seas undetected – until now,” said David Kroodsma, the director of research and innovation at GFW and co-lead author of the study. “On land, we have detailed maps of almost every road and building on the planet. In contrast, growth in our ocean has been largely hidden from public view. This study helps eliminate the blind spots and shed light on the breadth and intensity of human activity at sea.”Map: proportion of industrial fishing activity recorded by public tracking systemsThe open data, technology and mapping used in the study will be freely available, said Kroodsma, heralding a new era in ocean management and transparency.",

He is managing director of Moorfoot Capital, according to his LinkedIn profile.Douglas-Miller also chaired a charity called the Atlantic Salmon Trust, where Scottish secretary Alister Jack sat on the board and King Charles was the patron.He has attracted criticism from Ramblers Scotland for apparently making it difficult for walkers to access a site at East Lothian’s Lammermuir Hills, which is part of his Hopes estate.The area became increasingly popular with walkers during the pandemic, but the estate brought in a new car park and put up a gate, with access reportedly allowed only three or four days a week and requiring permits bought in advance.In a statement last March, reported by the National, Ramblers Scotland said: “Our members reported that there were only 14 permits a month to be sold, despite the car park having space for 20 cars, and these had immediately sold out.“We do not believe it is sustainable to continue to create a car park which is only available on certain days and on purchase of a permit.“This is an indirect obstruction to public access given there is no public transport to this site and it is a long walk from Gifford or surrounding settlements.”Jon Moses, from the Right to Roam campaign, criticised the appointment. “The government have put yet another unelected major landowner … in charge of our environment and rural affairs. Defra increasingly resembles a genteel medieval court.“Meanwhile its long awaited access reforms appear to amount to little more than taxpayer handouts to landowners in exchange for permission to access a few woodlands.",

Most call for fresh white breadcrumbs, made without the crusts, as well as a clove-studded onion that’s infused with milk and then thrown in the bin. Why, I have no clue. Save time and waste, and embrace the beige: use brown bread, keep the crusts on (even bread ends work here) and add a little grated onion instead of using and chucking a whole one. Your brown bread sauce will be more nutritious and flavourful for it. Even if you’re a staunch traditionalist and insist on using a whole onion, after lifting it from the milk, remove the cloves, cut the onion in half and roast it alongside your other Christmas veg, or use it as a trivet on which to roast the meat (at the very least it will give your gravy a great head start), or save it and put in a Boxing Day stew.Leftover brown bread sauce (with dairy and vegan options)When I make bread sauce, I tend to use stale brown bread, complete with crusts, bread ends and all, because that’s what we usually buy in. It will turn the sauce a delicate, light beige colour, and fill it with flavour and nutrition. Keep bread ends and crusts out of plastic packaging, so they can dry completely, then box up until needed, or freeze. I’ve included options to make a vegan version of the sauce, too, but all the ingredients are pretty much interchangeable, so use whatever you have available.I love the pungent, cinnamonny, bubblegum aroma of fresh bay leaves, but they are expensive to buy. Fortunately, they grow in huge abundance, so even if you don’t have a bay tree, ask a neighbour or a friend for any trimmed leaves. To preserve them, just hang them up somewhere in the kitchen until dried, then store them in a jar for up to a year.",

The work of the committee is at a “critical stage”, he added. “It is not helpful that it does not yet have a new chair as it carries out this work.”The economist Lord Stern, who is chair of the institute, said: “It seems to be yet another signal that the government does not take climate change policy seriously enough. All this is damaging the confidence of other countries and of investors in the UK’s commitment to climate action.”The failure to find a new committee chair is the latest example of a lack of consistency displayed by Sunak towards his party’s green commitments. This year, he dismayed environmentalists when he announced legislation for an annual system of oil and gas licensing in the North Sea which followed a scaling back of other measures including delays to a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.The Climate Change Committee is a body of experts set up under the 2008 Climate Change Act to guide national policies for controlling emissions and for helping the country prepare for the impact of global warming. In the past, it has been highly critical of Britain’s poor performance in areas including the nation’s flood defences and domestic energy efficiency.In July 2022, it was announced that Lord Deben – who was due to stand down – would continue in the post for an extra nine months while a new chair was sought.",

Meanwhile, ExxonMobil quietly withdrew funding for plans to use algae to create low-carbon fuel, while Shell announced it would not increase its investments in renewable energy this year, despite earlier promises to slash its emissions.The letter calls on Barclays to end all financing and underwriting of oil and gas companies – not only their projects – and to boost funding of firms behind wind and solar energy significantly.In May, more than 500 students and recent graduates made a similar pledge aimed at insurers that they said supported controversial fossil fuel projects. That letter was directed at the world’s largest insurance market, Lloyd’s of London, and addressed to individual firms including Beazley, Hiscox, Chaucer and Tokio Marine Kiln.“New recruitment of the younger generation will be another headache for Barclays as long as it continues to finance companies building new oil and gas infrastructure, since it relies heavily on Stem [science, engineering, technology and mathematics] applicants from Oxbridge and other top universities,” said Michelle Hemmingfield, a representative of Students Organising for Sustainability UK, which spearheaded the letter.The career boycott is the latest headache for Barclays, which was targeted by climate campaigners at its AGM in May and faced pressure over its sponsorship of Wimbledon, as well as over its ties to the National Trust.",

However, there is only £110m up for grabs and it will be doled out on a first-come, first-served basis, with car drivers having to vie with van, motorbike and minibus owners for the money.It is just the latest scrappage scheme to resume in the UK, joining others in Birmingham, Bristol and Scotland, which all have their own low emissions zones.German visitor fined £3,150 for driving in London’s Ulez zoneRead moreSince 2019, drivers of most petrol cars first registered before 2006 (those with Euro 3 engines and below) and most diesel cars bought up to 2015 (not Euro 6) have been deemed too polluting to drive in London’s Ulez, which was expanded to include all roads within the north and south circulars in October 2021. Noncompliant vehicles can still drive in it but must pay a £12.50 daily charge.With the zone to be expanded again on 29 August, TfL has relaunched its scrappage scheme, in part to counter claims that the Ulez adversely affects the poorest households. It is thought that about 15% of vehicles in the newly enlarged area will not comply.To be eligible for the scrappage payments, drivers have to live in one of the capital’s 32 boroughs, have a disability, or be in receipt of one of a long list of benefits. These include universal credit, carer’s allowance, child tax credit, income support and jobseeker’s allowance.The applicant must have owned the car they want to scrap on 30 January 2022.

But conservationists have found the habitats to be bare, with no amphibians or their young to be seen.Kathy Wormald, the chief executive of the amphibian charity Froglife, told the Guardian: “We are receiving a lot of reports of no amphibians – frogs, toads and newts. We are also getting reports from our toad patrollers of lower numbers migrating, but we will not know for definite until later in the year when we have all of their data.“We have noticed a steady increase in low numbers being reported by the public over the past few years. We think that the variable climate patterns, with warmer winters but then cold well into the spring months, when they would migrate to the ponds, is having an impact on their behaviour patterns.”Rare natterjack toads have been struggling due to changing weather patterns, with populations devastated.Emily Lake, who looks after the toads at the Cheshire Wildlife Trust, said: “Changing weather patterns and lack of rain means we are seriously worried for the long-term survival of the natterjack toad colony at Red Rocks nature reserve on the Wirral.“Rare and protected natterjacks live in the sand dunes, spawning in shallow freshwater pools, fed by rainwater and runoff from surrounding land, and where pools are warmed by the sun. However, over the past few years with changing weather patterns and drier winters the ponds are not filling up properly over winter.”She said last year was particularly devastating because the lack of fresh water caused the natterjack pools to be filled with saltwater, and all 41 toadspawn strings in them were lost.“The passionate group of Our Dee Estuary citizen science volunteers who monitor the natterjack toad pools for spawn and tadpoles were visibly upset at the devastation of the potential natterjack population last year,” Lake said.“We hope that a few brave toads are spawning in small pools amongst the reedbeds.",

It was the last place it was possible to wild camp without seeking permission.Darwall, Dartmoor’s sixth-largest landowner, brought the case against the national park authority, arguing that the right to wild camp on the moors never existed. The owner of the 1,619-hectare (4,000-acre) Blachford estate on southern Dartmoor offers pheasant shoots, deerstalking and holiday rentals on his land.On Saturday, hundreds of protesters from the Right to Roam campaign are to march on his land in protest at having their right to wild camp taken away. They are outraged that landowners this week including Darwall have struck a deal with the national park in which they are paid to allow camping on small portions of their land. Campaigners have called it a “stitch-up”.Natural England, the government body in charge of enforcing conservation measures in national parks, has warned the estate not to release pheasants near Dendles Wood, a fragment of temperate rainforest on the southern edge of Dartmoor, adjacent to the Blachford estate. It is protected as a national nature reserve (NNR) and site of special scientific interest (SSSI), and falls within the Dartmoor special area of conservation (SAC). The letter to the estate contained details on the necessary maintenance to retain these statuses, including not releasing pheasants.In a conservation plan for the wood, released under freedom of information laws, Natural England says that “operations likely to damage the special interest” of Dendles Wood include “the release into the site of any wild, feral or domestic animal” and “introduction of and changes in game and waterfowl management and hunting practice”.",

Skunks produce a noxious, sulphur-smelling spray from their anal scent glands, but only as a defence mechanism.So, as long as you don’t sit next to it on the bus, you’re fine? Actually, a skunk can direct its spray with uncanny accuracy up to three metres away. And the smell is notoriously hard to get rid of.How would an American skunk get to London in the first place? Did it paint out its stripe to disguise itself as a cat, like Pepé? It may be part of a population that originated with escaped pet skunks.Why would anyone keep a stinky giant skunk as a pet?

The tube keeps London moving, though often in cramped, uncomfortable and unhygienic conditions.However, Beri believes she has found a way to improve travel for concerned commuters. She has developed a phone app that can direct passengers to routes that offer minimal air pollution.“The UK safe limit for healthy air is to have fewer than 25 small particles in a cubic metre of air,” said Beri. “In some places on the underground, it can top 200 per cubic metre. I want to help people avoid that.”Studies have suggested that long-term exposure to fine particulates could be linked to increased rates of chronic bronchitis and increased mortality from lung cancer and heart disease.Beri, 29, will be given one of Innovate UK’s Young Innovators awards at a ceremony this week for her work on developing the app. She will be among the 94 young entrepreneurs who will receive some £1.25m in grants to help them tackle some of biggest challenges facing society in Britain. Other inventions to be given awards range from cheap alternatives to plastic based on onion skins to a smart medication dispenser that promotes patient independence.Beri’s app suggests routes that provide the lowest risk of breathing air with high pollution levels. “It’s like a TfL [Transport for London] or Google app but instead of offering the speediest journey between destinations it provides routes with the lowest air pollution,” she said.An example is provided by a passenger from North Harrow tube station to Canary Wharf, part of London’s business district, said Beri. “If you go the quickest way, via the Jubilee line, then you face pollution that is about 220 particles per cubic metre. If you take the slower route and stay on the Metropolitan line, you will face pollution of about 50 particles per cubic metre. That is still over the safe limit but it is less than a quarter of what you would experience on the Jubilee line.",

Instead, rates settled around 43-44% between 2011 and 2018-19.The NAO also found that four years on from an ambitious 2018 strategy on waste, ministers and officials had failed to develop “effective long-term delivery plans that set out how it will achieve its ambitions”.Such a lack of clarity made it more difficult for businesses to prepare for investment and regulatory changes necessary to meet the government’s long-term plans, the NAO said.While progress was noted in some areas, the watchdog repeatedly expressed concerns about the adequacy of long-term planning and highlighted delays to collection and packaging reforms.It found Defra had not yet set out how England’s waste system as a whole would need to change to meet the government’s objectives, although officials were working on a “roadmap” for waste infrastructure up to 2035.Elsewhere, concerns were raised that Defra, led by Thérèse Coffey, did not possess “a full understanding of the nature and extent of the changes that will be required to realise the benefits it expects from the reforms”.“Without this, there are risks that it loses focus on benefits in the run-up to launching the schemes, and that the reforms fail to achieve the levels of recycling, waste reduction and greenhouse gas emissions savings that are needed,” the report, published on Friday, warned.It also suggested that uncertainties remained about the scale of the benefits of the government’s planned deposit return scheme for drinks bottles and cans, with auditors noting that the department “has no current plans to test the scheme through piloting”.",

But the new research shows total ecosystem collapse is “inevitable”, if the losses are not reversed, the scientists said.The Permian-Triassic extinction event, known as the “Great Dying” occurred 252 million years ago. It was driven by global heating resulting from huge volcanic eruptions and wiped out 95% of life on Earth.However, species are being lost today even faster than in any of the previous five mass extinctions that have struck the planet. Wildlife is being destroyed via the razing of natural habitats for farming and mining, pollution and overhunting. Humanity relies on healthy global ecosystems for clean air and water, as well as food.The new research examined in detail marine fossils found in China from before, during and after the Great Dying. Healthy ecosystems rely on the complex interaction of plants, predators and prey, with each group of similar species playing a unique role.‘Crucial’ Cop15 deal includes target to protect 30% of nature on Earth by 2030Read moreThe scientists found half the species went extinct with virtually no change in the overall functioning of the ecosystem, because some creatures still remained in each role. However, once the last species in each role began to go extinct, the ecosystem rapidly collapsed. “Ecosystems were pushed to a tipping point from which they could not recover,” said Dr Yuangeng Huang, at the China University of Geosciences and lead author of the study.“We are currently losing species at a faster rate than in any of Earth’s past extinction events. It is probable that we are in the first phase of another, more severe mass extinction,” he said. “We cannot predict the tipping point that will send ecosystems into total collapse, but it is an inevitable outcome if we do not reverse biodiversity loss.”The research, published in the journal Current Biology, examined fossils from south China, which was a shallow sea during the Permian-Triassic mass extinction.",

While commercial poultry feed contains primarily crops, chickens are also fed fishmeal and fish oil.The US, Brazil and China are the world’s largest producers of both chicken and chicken feed, while the largest producers of salmon feed are Peru, Norway and Chile.In the future, the researchers noted, an expected increase in the price of fishmeal would raise “the question of whether the demand for land or marine feed resources are more sustainable, particularly given shifting diets and consumer preferences”.“Food is one of the biggest environmental pressures to the planet and we’re all trying to be more conscious about what we’re eating,” Kuempel said.",

A plan to ban sales of new cars with combustion engines has been pushed back five years to 2035, a phase-out of gas boilers in homes has been scaled back and homeowners and landlords will no longer be required to meet energy efficiency targets in insulating homes.The British prime minister claimed the moves would save families money while still adhering to the net zero target but the international reaction to the decision has been scathing.“This action from Rishi Sunak is a disgusting betrayal of vulnerable people around the world, not to mention economic vandalism upon his own country,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa.The UK has enjoyed a stellar reputation globally on its progress in cutting its own planet-heating emissions, which have fallen drastically as coal use has been virtually eliminated.",

Therefore, raising taxes on the wealthiest people and on big corporate polluters is critical to support the level of government spending required.”Rishi Sunak drew an angry response from campaigners and business leaders after watering down the UK’s net zero policies as he sought to draw dividing lines with Labour in the run-up to the election.While promising to invest up to £28bn in green jobs and industry towards the end of a first Labour term in government, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has ruled out new taxes on wealth. Labour has promised to scrap non-dom status, charge VAT on private school fees, and launch a more extensive windfall tax on energy company profits.",

There is a worldwide web of wise Anansi stories, too, which became an oral tradition of the Ashanti people and have been spun over and again, their morals tangled inside the scheming hero’s spirited adventures.Justin Audibert, the Unicorn’s new artistic director, retells three of them in a production for three- to seven-year-olds that is direct and effervescent. But it’s almost more striking to note what it is not. This is children’s theatre that is never over-egged or over-insistent. There are no winking asides to adults, no spoonfeeding the meaning to kids. Nothing feels superfluous. Each bit of interplay with the audience feels just right.The children sit safe in the shadow of Sadeysa Greenaway-Bailey’s set, with its tree trunks of bundled bamboo – several bearing instruments – and a canopy resembling upturned umbrellas. In contrast to the often male tone of the stories in which Anansi is father to six sons, the show is performed by a trio of women, each playing the webspinner in turn and bringing out different aspects of his character as well as portraying a supporting cast of goats, antelopes and a party-loving armadillo.In the first tale, Afia Abusham is a cranky Anansi who gathers up paper pieces of “wisdom” that have been dispersed among the crowd. Inveigling a young audience to part with their treasure is a test of persuasion for any performer and Abusham achieves it with charm. The tale ends with that cliche of children’s theatre, the shower of confetti – but the message makes the effect beautiful.",

She joined Lula’s cabinet after his 2002 election, but resigned in 2008 after a series of political battles linked to environmental policy.Guajajara was born in the Araribóia territory of the eastern Amazon and became one of the leading lights of Brazil’s flourishing Indigenous rights movement, as well as a prominent leftist politician.

MPs from across the political spectrum spoke in favour of the legislation before it passed.The government says the law, which will now move for debate in the Lords, will strengthen the conservation of endangered species and has widespread support from the British public. The ban was part of the 2019 Conservative election manifesto and comes after a high-profile anti-trophy hunting campaign backed by celebrities including Ricky Gervais, Brian May, Ed Sheeran and Joanna Lumley.But many scientists, environmentalists and African community leaders have said the new law could inadvertently accelerate the loss of wildlife, and accused celebrity campaigners of “neocolonialism”. They point to the contributions of regulated trophy hunting to the recovery of populations of black and white rhino in Namibia and South Africa and the snow leopard in Tajikistan.Amid strong views on both sides and accusations of misinformation from pro-hunting groups and anti-trophy hunting campaigners, MPs backed an amendment from Sir Christopher Chope to create an expert advisory board on the import ban. The ban will cover about 6,000 species and include some of the most endangered and charismatic animals, including hippos, leopards and polar bears.British hunters are not a large part of the trophy hunting industry and the ban is considered largely symbolic by conservationists. In 2015, the killing of Cecil the lion by a trophy hunter in Zimbabwe provoked global outrage and revulsion at the industry, where hunters pay tens of thousands of pounds to shoot and pose with the bodies of wild animals.The actor Peter Egan, a prominent anti-trophy hunting campaigner, said the vote was “sensational” news.Claire Bass, a senior director of campaigns and public affairs at Humane Society International-UK, also welcomed the vote.",

The records, starting in 1958, show an inexorable rise in ocean temperature, with an acceleration in warming after 1990.Sea surface temperatures are a major influence on the world’s weather. Hotter oceans help supercharge extreme weather, leading to more intense hurricanes and typhoons and more moisture in the air, which brings more intense rains and flooding. Warmer water also expands, pushing up sea levels and endangering coastal cities.The temperature of the oceans is far less affected by natural climate variability than the temperature of the atmosphere, making the oceans an undeniable indicator of global heating.Revealed: how climate breakdown is supercharging toll of extreme weatherRead moreLast year is expected to be the fourth or fifth hottest recorded for surface air temperatures when the final data is collated. During 2022, we saw the third La Niña event in a row, which is the cooler phase of an irregular climate cycle centred on the Pacific that affects global weather patterns. When El Niño returns, global air temperatures will be boosted even higher.The international team of scientists that produced the new ocean heat analysis concluded: “The Earth’s energy and water cycles have been profoundly altered due to the emission of greenhouse gases by human activities, driving pervasive changes in Earth’s climate system.”Prof John Abraham, at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota and part of the study team, said: “If you want to measure global warming, you want to measure where the warming goes, and over 90% goes into the oceans.“Measuring the oceans is the most accurate way of determining how out of balance our planet is.“We are getting more extreme weather because of the warming oceans and that has tremendous consequences all around the world.”Prof Michael Mann, at the University of Pennsylvania, also part of the team, said: “Warmer oceans mean there is more potential for bigger precipitation events, like we’ve seen this past year in Europe, Australia, and currently on the west coast of the US.",

Lord Callanan tweeted: “The government will publish the consultation on the future homes standard for new homes this year. We will implement the FHS in 2025, ensuring new homes are ready for net zero.”The delay would cause further problems for homeowners, said Juliet Phillips, senior policy adviser at the thinktank E3G.“The standard is an essential tool for ensuring all new homes are warm, healthy and highly efficient. Delay to the consultation, which was originally due this spring, had led to concern that the standard had been kicked into the long grass. As a vital policy for ensuring all new homes are green and cheap to run, any further delay to the standard would be costly for homeowners – and the planet.”Louise Hutchins, head of policy at the UK Green Building Council, added: “The best developers have spent years and millions gearing up for modern green building standards. This continued delay and uncertainty on new higher standards only benefits those who took a punt that the government would drag its feet on tackling the climate emergency.”An investigation by the Guardian this week found that housebuilders had benefited by at least £15bn over the last eight years by not having to construct homes to low-carbon standards.Installing heat pumps, solar panels and high-grade insulation on homes while building them is much less expensive than retrofitting them later. But if homes are built to these standards, the costs, which were roughly £5,000 a house before the Covid-19 pandemic and are now about £8,000 a house, are borne by the housebuilder.About 1.",

But after the flooding in Vermont this week, previous weather calamities – including Tropical Storm Irene, in 2011 – can offer some clues.Fish in Vermont’s rivers, primarily species of trout – brook, rainbow and brown – have been found to move upriver during increased water flow to less turbulent areas, including tributaries or flooded fields, or find refuge behind fallen trees or rocks.Wolverines are the ‘embodiment of wilderness’. Can they make a US comeback?Read more“This is definitely unprecedented, but studies of smaller floods show that often fish are not displaced and are in the same pools before and after a flood,” said Will Eldridge, an aquatic habitat biologist with Vermont’s fish and wildlife department. “They can often survive in place by finding some refuge behind a structure or ride the edges of the flow up into the flood plain.”After Hurricane Irene, though, some fish populations fell by 50%, Eldridge says.“But the silver lining is that fish populations do recover pretty quickly, and they can do that because there is less impact in the headwaters and smaller streams, or they can migrate and recolonize areas that have been impacted,” he continued. “So we work hard to protect those headwaters and also provide connectivity between streams and systems.”Fish are not the only type of wildlife that get displaced. Eldridge’s wife noticed a number of displaced skunks in Montpelier in the immediate aftermath of this week’s flood.

        "text": "EU ministers are expected to approve a draft law on emissions standards for cars on Tuesday, after reaching a deal with Germany over the weekend that ended a damaging row over a key part of Europe’s green deal.Pascal Canfin, a French centrist MEP who chairs the European parliament’s environment committee, said an EU law that all cars sold from 2035 must produce zero emissions “will be voted unchanged, including by Germany” on Tuesday.Diplomats meeting on Monday approved the compromise agreed between Berlin and Brussels over the weekend, which will allow some combustion engines if they fill up with so-called climate neutral e-fuels. Although Italy and Poland oppose the law and Bulgaria is abstaining, it is expected to be approved by a majority of EU countries on Tuesday.The row blew up after Germany’s Free Democratic party, a member of the three-way governing coalition, withdrew support from an EU plan to ban the sale of new cars powered by internal combustion from 2035 without stronger guarantees for e-fuels.After going back on a deal agreed between EU ministers and the European parliament last October, the German government secured further concessions over the future use of e-fuels, which are not yet commercially available.Germany’s transport minister, Volker Wissing, said: “Vehicles with internal combustion engines can still be newly registered after 2035 if they fill up exclusively with CO2-neutral fuels.”The European Commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, tweeted that after the agreement with Germany, the commission would follow up “swiftly with the necessary legal steps” to implement what had been agreed and get the regulation adopted “as swiftly as possible”.The dispute was a sign of growing tensions about the EU’s green deal, a set of laws intended to ensure Europe achieves net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Berlin’s U-turn on a done deal also triggered concerns among some countries of copycat behaviour that would undermine EU decision-making.The pro-business FDP’s last-minute revolt reflected concerns in the powerful German car industry among companies that have specialised in manufacturing parts unique to combustion engines such as exhaust pipes.E-fuels, which can be made from captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen, or the chemical or thermal treatment of biofuels or biomass, are thought likely to remain scarce for years to come.",

As it grows stronger, scientists fear it will raise the risk in some countries of hunger, drought and malaria.Coupled with hotter global temperatures from burned fossil fuels, the shift could make a host of heat-related dangers worse, from heart disease to suicide.“Heat is unambiguously dangerous,” said Gregory Wellenius, head of the centre for climate and health at Boston university’s school of public health. “Sometimes it leads to hospitalisation, other times it leads to death. Then there’s indirect impacts that follow up on that.”El Niño is the result of natural shifts in winds and ocean temperatures. It brings heavier floods to some parts of the planet while drying others out. The last major El Niño was in 2016, which was the hottest year on record.Because scientists know that weather patterns have changed this year, people and governments can better prepare in the regions affected.“El Niño does not mean more disasters globally than in any other years,” said Walter Baethgen, a scientist at Columbia university’s international research institute for climate and society. “What it does change is our ability to predict what the climate will be in some parts of the world. That’s going to help us take anticipatory actions.”A particular worry is the effect on food security. Shocks to weather patterns could be fatal for farmers in countries already reeling from the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather events made worse by the climate crisis.“To be realistic, many countries do not have many degrees of freedom,” said Baethgen, referring to their ability to stave off hunger they know is coming. But other actors such as the UN and the World Food Programme can use the information to prepare, he added. “They know in El Niño years some areas will have an increased threat of food insecurity.",

Municipal utilities will be required to remove the compounds from drinking water, which could set off a wave of lawsuits directed at PFAS polluters, including the US military and chemical producers like 3M, DuPont and Chemours.Toxic ‘forever chemicals’ found in toilet paper around the worldRead moreThe new rules are “groundbreaking”, said Erik Olson, senior strategic director for the Natural Resources Defense Council non-profit, which tracks PFAS pollution.“We have a five-alarm fire, and setting strong standards will help ensure the fundamental right of every family to have safe water flowing from their kitchen tap,” he said.PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 14,000 chemicals often used to make products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and are linked to cancer, liver problems, thyroid issues, birth defects, kidney disease, decreased immunity and other serious health problems.By some estimates, PFAS are contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million Americans, and the EPA has said it has moved more quickly to regulate the compounds than any in the agency’s history.Between 2016 and 2022, the agency worked off an advisory health limit of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOS and PFOA, two compounds commonly produced and used for decades. Last year, after science showed virtually no level of exposure to drinking water is safe, the EPA set non-enforceable “advisory health limits” of 0.02 ppt and 0.004 ppt for PFOA and PFOS, respectively.The new legal limits for PFOS and PFOA is 4 ppt each, levels that science shows are still dangerous to drink.",

It has been hugely controversial among the green wing of the Conservative party – the former minister Chris Skidmore announced on Friday he would be stepping down as an MP as a result of the proposed legislation.Sharma, the Conservative MP for Reading West who was president of the Cop26 Glasgow climate summit in 2021, rarely rebels against the government, but was heavily critical of the bill.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I will not be voting for this bill.” He added: “What this bill does do is reinforce that unfortunate perception about the UK rowing back from climate action.”He said: “We saw this last autumn with the chopping and changing of some policies and actually not being serious about our international commitments. Just a few weeks ago at Cop28 the UK government signed up to transition away from fossil fuels. This bill is actually about doubling down on new oil and gas licences. It is actually the opposite of what we agreed to do internationally, so I won’t be supporting it.”Downing Street on Monday rejected Sharma’s criticisms. A spokesperson said: “The government believes that it’s common sense to make the most of what we can produce here rather than shipping in from foreign regimes with higher emissions.”Ministers are not expecting a major rebellion on Monday night, although Zac Goldsmith, the Tory peer and former environment minister, urged Conservative MPs to follow Sharma’s example and vote against the bill.He told the Guardian: “Conservatives are facing almost certain defeat at the election and so now is not the time for colleagues to be slavishly obedient to a leadership that simply will not be there in a matter of months.“This vote is about something so much more important than the average vote, and members will not be able to sanitise their records in the years to come.",

However, I would describe this as a teachable moment,” said Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon.“I hope schools, colleges and universities see this in the positive light it is meant and equally hope those students act sensibly with making sure adults know where they are and making up the missed work.”But the National Association of Head Teachers, which last week offered some support for those joining the strike, gave a more hard-headed assessment to its members as the day of the action approached.'Our house is on fire': Greta Thunberg, 16, urges leaders to act on climateRead more“Pupils should only be out of school in exceptional circumstances. Whilst NAHT supports the right of young people to express themselves, first and foremost, pupils should be in school during term time,” the union said.“While a school leader’s role is to ensure children attend school, are kept safe and receive a good quality of education, it is right that individual school leaders can decide how best to respond to any proposed protest by students in their school on Friday.”Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said young people were right to be concerned about climate change but warned that teachers had genuine safeguarding issues to consider.“It’s not appropriate for pupils to just walk out of school.

It is a laudable aspiration. Biodiversity in Britain, as across the planet, is in peril as the climate heats up, pollution causes increasing harm to the landscape and alien species spread over the countryside. Considerable care will be needed if we are to protect nature, which is vital to our health, wellbeing and survival, from continued degradation. Limiting the ecological injury of pesticides is an encouraging move.Unfortunately, Coffey’s words have not been matched by action. Incredibly, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has decided to waive restrictions on the use of a class of highly dangerous powerful toxins and permit their release on crops. Neonicotinoids have been described as the Novichok of bees: a single teaspoon is sufficient to kill more than a billion, say scientists.The EU has made it plain that, because of their alarming toxicity, neonics have no role to play in modern agricultureFor this reason, the UK Expert Committee on Pesticides last week argued that requests for these toxins to be used to protect sugar beet crops against attack from aphids should be turned down. For the third year in a row, this advice was promptly rejected and their dispersal was given the go-ahead by Defra. Such sidestepping of expert advice contrasts starkly with the European Union, which has made it plain that, because of their alarming toxicity, neonics, as these chemicals are also known, have no role to play in modern agriculture. The EU has refused all requests to allow them to be sprayed on crops in Europe.The UK government’s contrarian insistence on using neonics has appalled many scientists and green activists. By using a class of chemical capable of such pernicious impacts merely to protect sugar from aphid-borne disease, the government is endangering a host of other insect species, including bees and other pollinators that are crucial to the flourishing of our crops and flowers.",

Copernicus was about to publish his theory that the Earth revolved around the sun. The Ming dynasty ruled China. More than 480 years on, the tree stands 24 metres tall and on Wednesday was crowned as tree of the year in the annual Woodland Trust competition. Generations have scavenged its chestnuts, taken the sticks that have fallen for firewood and sheltered beneath its splendid branches. It is not merely part of the landscape; it is part of community life.This year’s contest highlighted urban trees, particularly vulnerable to felling and disease. There is now a host of evidence on the benefits that trees bring, not only in forests but in cities too. They range from boosting mental health, and even immunity, to reducing noise and air pollution, helping to cool the air, and reducing runoff in heavy rains – increasingly important as global temperatures rise. Beyond those lies the sheer pleasure that people take in them. The instinctive bond people feel was highlighted by the outrage and grief that greeted the overnight felling of the Sycamore Gap tree at Hadrian’s Wall last month by unknown vandals. Though practically a sapling compared with Wrexham’s tree – it was planted a mere 130 years ago – it had attracted marriage proposals and scatterings of ashes, as well as starring in countless photographs. Though the stump is expected to regrow, few of us will see anything approaching its former might in our lifetimes.This summer, Sheffield city council’s new Labour leader acknowledged that some residents would “never forgive” it for its draconian programme to fell thousands of street trees (many of them healthy), which saw elderly protesters being arrested in dawn raids. One of the nominees in this year’s awards was an elm which narrowly escaped that culling.In Plymouth, the overnight felling of more than 100 trees helped to bring down the Tory council last year.",

The WWF has predicted that the number of red pandas left in the wild could be as low at 2,500.“These twin cubs give us double hope for the species, as they were born as part of an important European breeding programme for endangered red pandas, designed to keep a backup population safe in conservation zoos – while we tackle the issues they’re facing in the wild,” Timberlake added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

They add to a slew of documents that record a decades-long misinformation campaign waged by Exxon, which are cited in a growing number of state and municipal lawsuits against big oil.Many of the newly released documents date back to the 2006-16 tenure of former chief executive Rex Tillerson, who oversaw a major shift in the company’s climate messaging. In 2006, Exxon publicly accepted that the climate crisis posed risks, and it went on to support the Paris agreement. Yet behind closed doors, the company behaved differently, the documents show.In 2008, Exxon pledged to stop funding climate-denier groups. But that very same year, company leadership said it would support the company in directing a scientist to help the nation’s top oil and gas lobbying group write a paper about the “uncertainty” of measuring greenhouse gas emissions.New fossil fuel projects ‘very unwise economic risk’ says global energy chiefRead moreThe company’s preoccupation with climate uncertainty continued. Before one meeting with company scientists in 2012, one researcher expressed an interest in finding “‘skeptic’ arguments that we consider to be not yet disproven”. During a board meeting about climate science and policy that same year, the Exxon board member Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, who is the former chief executive of Nestlé, said there was “still uncertainty in predicting future climate changes and impacts” and also said that “money and effort spent on climate change is misplaced”.The documents also show Exxon’s displeasure with scientific warnings from top authorities. After the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations’ top climate body, sounded the alarm about the urgent need to curb greenhouse-gas emissions in 2011, Tillerson told a leading Exxon researcher that the IPCC’s warning was “not credible”, and said he was “dissatisfied” with the media’s coverage of the warning about the worst-case climate scenarios.",

And so all of the children in the world came to know a single piece of information.Is it a myth? Yes, it is a myth. The daddy longlegs is not harmful to humans, but they can kill redback spiders (Australian black widows). Because redback venom can kill humans, people may have believed daddy longlegs could kill us, too.Is it a myth that the daddy longlegs is the most poisonous spider on Earth? Yes, it is.",

So local walkers were horrified when they woke up one morning to an act of “environmental vandalism” that left behind the maimed stumps of 100 ancient beech trees.Residents in the east Devon community are grieving the loss of the beloved trees, which were located in a special conservation area and site of special scientific interest, home to lots of local plants and animals, after a government agency issued a licence for the trees to be felled without consulting the community or council.An application was made by a local landowner to the Forestry Commission, a branch of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It would not comment on individual cases, but said all decisions were taken in line with its standards.The trees were located in a special conservation area. Photograph: Fiona CarrollAlan Pearce, a tree warden from the area, said: “It certainly ought to be a fairly wide consultation because it’s part of our heritage, grown-out hedges that go back hundreds of years. Once they’re gone you’re talking about 200 years to regrow. The stumps look nearly all of them perfectly sound and solid. I can’t see they can say they were diseased or dying. We’re meant to be planting trees, not felling them.”He said people were “absolutely horrified”, with one walker in tears over the decision, which he suggested may have been taken in order to improve grazing land in the adjacent field.Fiona Carroll, another resident, said: “Many people walk in this area as it is part of a large expanse of heathland and they are at a loss as to why this has been allowed to happen. These were, in my view, valuable landscape and wildlife trees situated along an extensive ancient Devon bank. The roots had grown into large supporting structures giving many a distinctive look. My current impression is that this destruction is nothing short of an act of environmental vandalism.”Ewan Macdonald, who researches how people engage with the environment at the University of Oxford, said he was not surprised the felling had provoked such an emotional reaction because of the way people connected with trees.",

Last week the state, along with Nevada and California, agreed to significant cutbacks in the use of water from the Colorado River, which is rapidly shrinking.The farmers dealing with water shortages even before historic Colorado River dealRead moreArizona, one of the driest states in the US, gets about a third of its water from the Colorado River, with approximately another 40% coming from groundwater sources. The state’s recently concluded analysis projected a water shortfall of 4.86m acre-feet (6bn cubic meters) in the Phoenix area over the next 100 years. In response, the state said it will deny new certificates of Assured Water Supply, which enable home construction.Arizona has imposed such restrictions on other areas, and not all of greater Phoenix requires a certificate, but experts said the measure was certain to slow home-building in an area representing over half the state’s population that has become a magnet for people in the US searching for affordable housing.“It’s a reality check. We need to have the water supplies in order to grow,” said Sharon Megdal, director of the University of Arizona’s Water Resources Research Center.The department of water resources said developers would need to find other sources to build.Those sources could include officially designated entities that have excess water to sell, or farmers or Native American tribes with water rights, but all are facing short supplies given overuse and a historic drought this century.Recycled water or desalinated brackish groundwater could also increase future supplies, Megdal said.",

It plans to increase the level at which deals are scrutinised by the commission under state aid rules.Biden’s new rules, introduced last autumn, have reinvigorated the renewables market in the US, leading to a wave of new projects.

Reports of sightings on the London Underground – so far unsubstantiated, but quickly addressed by Sadiq Khan – are not surprising either. Bedbugs are everywhere. Bedbugs can be found in any city around the world, in any location, from youth hostels to five-star hotels. There are not yet clear numbers on the purported “explosion” of bedbugs in Paris, but in the UK, pest control company Rentokil reported a 65% increase in bedbug infestations in the UK from 2022 to 2023.As we return to pre-pandemic levels of travel, bedbugs are on the move, and this is likely to cause more sightings. They tend to travel in people’s suitcases and end up in our bedrooms – they are incredibly good hitchhikers. The rise in popularity of secondhand furniture is another way for bedbugs to enter our homes.Another factor that may be behind the increase in bedbug sightings is resistance to insecticides. During the 20th century, strong insecticides like DDT, that were highly effective against bedbugs, came into use, and famously infested cities such as New York and London were able to get the problem under control. But over time the insects evolved resistance, changing the parts of their bodies the insecticides were disrupting. Many of today’s bedbug populations are mostly unbothered by commonly used insecticides.Climate change is also likely to be a contributing factor, as most insects breed better in warmer temperatures; so if there are more hotter months in the year, then there’s more chance of insects breeding in greater numbers.‘Although bedbugs’ bites won’t transmit diseases to humans, they are a nuisance and cause stress and mental health problems for victims.’ Photograph: Akos Nagy/ShutterstockI can understand the current public anxiety. But we should try to temper our instinctive disgust. We react this way for several reasons: they invade our personal space, and it can be very unsettling knowing you are being bitten while asleep, creating a sense of vulnerability. The resilience of bedbugs also makes eradication difficult, and it can be a drawn-out process, causing further frustration and distress. But bedbugs don’t discriminate; they aren’t associated with unclean spaces.",

Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianNatural England’s most recent assessments, conducted earlier this year, indicated the majority of these sensitive habitats were in an “unfavourable condition” even before the current prolonged dry weather.One lifelong Borrowdale resident, Billy Bland, 76, told the Guardian: “This dry spell is earlier and longer than I can remember. I don’t remember the beck ever being as low.”Warmer water carries less oxygen, while low water levels raise the concentration of river pollutants, such as sewage and agricultural runoff. These factors “affect the whole of the ecosystem from the insects that live in the water to the fish, right through to the otters and the birds”, said Mackay.Mackay singled out salmon for particular concern. She said water temperatures of 22-24C were potentially fatal for the fish, already in decline nationally.Being turned into a ‘rapid conveyor of water’ has made the river less resilient to drought and flooding, says Ruth Mackay. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“We think climate change has a lot to answer for,” said Mackay, pointing to an increased frequency of extreme weather events, including droughts. But in Borrowdale, she said, the negative effects of the climate crisis were compounded by modifications to the river system, made over centuries, mostly with the aim of draining farmland.",

Noaa data from the 50 most populous cities in the US shows the heatwave season is 49 days longer now compared with the 1960s.The effects of heat on health are cumulative, and the body only starts to recover when the temperature drops below 27C (80F). Even small temperature rises can result in increased deaths and illness.“Extreme heat is killer heat, and multiple-day heatwaves – and early-season ones – are the biggest threat, because people can’t get a break and the body can only sustain it for so long,” said Brenda Ekwurzel, the director of climate science for the climate and energy programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US. “These are not isolated heat events; this is what the turbo-charged climate change world looks like.”In Phoenix, Arizona, the National Weather Service has issued a “very dangerous long-duration heat” alert for the second consecutive week, with daily temperatures expected to fluctuate between 29C (85F) and 47C (118F).Temperatures in Europe are about 10-15C hotter than usual, and the heatwave is lasting a long time, as an established high-pressure system across the region is causing temperatures to climb every day. Clouds of Saharan dust are also making conditions worse.The sun has heated the sea, too, which is causing a feedback loop, prolonging the heatwave on land. Usually cool air blowing off the Mediterranean brings some relief.“Unusually high sea surface temperatures are also occurring across the region, with many parts of the Mediterranean seeing surface temperatures as high as 25-28C,” said Rebekah Sherwin, a meteorologist from the Met Office’s global forecasting team. “This will exacerbate the effects of the heat over surrounding land areas, as even in coastal regions overnight temperatures are unlikely to drop much below the mid-20s celsius.",

Some of the objects look like leather, others like animal skin or lace. Adorning a jacket on a mannequin, it looks too beautiful to pass as seaweed.A top woven from seaweed. Photograph: Sigga Ella/The GuardianThe artist, who has been working with the material for 30 years, says seaweed has huge potential for use as a sustainable material for design.“When I started using seaweed they said ‘you are crazy’. So then I thought ‘then I’m doing something right’,” says Þorvaldsdóttir over coffee in her candlelit kitchen. “My mission in life is to bring out the beauty in life and in seaweed.”The artist has worked in theatre as a puppeteer, mask maker, costume maker, and production designer, and in drama-based teaching. She is now working on an exhibition to be held in Iceland next year.Despite being the world’s second largest global aquaculture product by volume, seaweed is usually associated with food rather than as a material. And that’s a mistake, says Þorvaldsdóttir. “Everyone is focused on seaweed as a food and nothing else.”She often works with younger designers and makers to help unlock the potential of seaweed as a material for future generations. “Some want to continue and others not because it is a new material and it doesn’t come instead of anything,” she says. “I can see people are getting more aware that the textile industry is so polluting, and the only way we can correct that is our attitude towards how we treat ourselves.”But seaweed is not a straightforward material to work with. First, Þorvaldsdóttir goes to the shore to select her material, negotiating slippery rocks and, on occasion, whirlpools. Seaweed varies enormously from piece to piece, depending on where she finds it, as well as between types.“The same kind of species, like Saccharina [latissima, also known as sugar kelp and kombu] and [Laminaria] digitata [also known as oarweed] – they can be very, very different,” she says.",

Shively has cast the project as key to the Biden administration’s push to reach green energy goals and make the US less dependent on foreign countries for such minerals.The Pebble Limited Partnership, the developer behind Pebble Mine, is owned by Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd.Tuesday’s announcement marks only the 14th time in the roughly 50-year history of the federal Clean Water Act that the EPA has flexed its powers to bar or restrict activities over potential impacts to waters, including fisheries.The EPA administrator, Michael Regan, said his agency’s use of its so-called veto authority in this case “underscores the true irreplaceable and invaluable natural wonder that is Bristol Bay”.The veto is a victory for the environment, economy and tribes of Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, which have fought the proposal for more than a decade, said Joel Reynolds, western director and senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.The mine would have jeopardized the region’s salmon fishery, which brings thousands of jobs to the area and supplies about half the world’s sockeye salmon, Reynolds said.“It’s a victory for science over politics. For biodiversity over extinction. For democracy over corporate power,” Reynolds said.The Pebble deposit is near the headwaters of the Bristol Bay watershed, which supports a bounty of salmon “unrivaled anywhere in North America”, the EPA has said.The agency, citing an analysis by the US army corps of engineers, said discharges of dredged or fill material to build and operate the proposed mine site would result in a loss of nearly 100 miles (160km) of stream habitat, as well as wetland areas.",

However, these weather patterns are probably exacerbated by climate breakdown and the heating atmosphere.“The more we burn fossil fuels, the more excess heat will be taken out by the oceans, which means the longer it will take to stabilise them and get them back to where they were,” Burgess told the BBC.This week, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, announced more than 100 new oil and gas licences in the North Sea, against the advice of climate experts.Oceans also regulate the climate, soaking up heat, driving weather patterns, acting as a carbon sink and providing respite as cool air blowing off the sea can make hot land temperatures more bearable. However, these useful impacts lessen as the oceans heat, and warm waters also have less ability to absorb carbon dioxide, which means there will be more of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Warming oceans also contribute to ice melting, which causes sea level rise.Sea surface temperature measurements made from ships go back more than 150 years and are some of the longest instrumental records available for understanding the climate. For the past 40 years, there have also been measurements available from satellites and buoys.From this data, scientists have found that over the full period of the records, global mean sea surface temperature has increased by close to 0.9C, and that the increase over the past four decades is about 0.6C. The latest five-year average is about 0.2C above the average between 1991 and 2020.",

Raghu is at the heart of this documentary directed by Kartiki Gonsalves that uses a tender family dynamic in the middle of an Indian forest reserve to comment on climate change, shrinking animal habitats and our warped perception of the wild.“I just found it beautiful that this little family had this unusual bond, especially in a time when we are struggling to coexist,” Gonsalves says over a call from the US. In 2017, while driving back from Bengaluru to her hometown Ooty, a hill station in the Western Ghats of southern India, Gonsalves saw a caregiver giving a young calf called Raghu a bath. That’s when it all began. She did not, however, begin shooting in earnest until she had earned the trust of both Bomman and Bellie, the middle-aged couple looking after young calves on the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve.The 42-min film has a warm, sunny texture but also operates in the shadow of tragedy and grief. “Raghu is the living embodiment of climate change and shrinking habitats for Asian elephants. He lost his mother to an electrocution when their herd meandered into a nearby village. To me this bittersweet aspect of the story was crucial to what I wanted to say,” Gonsalves says. Human-animal conflict is a huge problem in the southern Ghats of India, where migrating elephants and civilisation regularly come into contact to calamitous, often disastrous, effect. A government report last year found that more than 550 elephants had died of electrocution in the country over an eight-year period. There has obviously been a human cost as well.The elephant is considered both a religious figure in Indian folklore and a marauding wild animal.",

It has been welcomed by green groups, clean air campaigners and some businesses, although Conservatives have opposed the charge and said most people in outer boroughs do not want it.Khan said the capital’s toxic air, and the climate emergency, made it a public health imperative, and that revenue raised would go into public transport.New ultra-low emission zone mapAnnouncing the decision at Bonus Pastor school in Lewisham, an area with dangerously poor air quality, Khan said: “The latest evidence shows that air pollution is making us sick from cradle to the grave. Londoners are developing life-changing illnesses such as cancer, lung disease, dementia and asthma. And it’s especially dangerous for children.”He said the zone, which was expanded from the heart of the city to boroughs within the north and south circular roads last October, had been “transformational”, reducing harmful pollution levels by almost a half in central London. “Expanding the Ulez London-wide will mean 5 million more people will be able to breathe cleaner air and live healthier lives,” he said.Khan said the rising cost of living was a major consideration and that the £110m scrappage scheme would help people who most needed it to scrap or retrofit non-compliant vehicles.Alex Williams, Transport for London’s chief customer and strategy officer, said the scheme would offer “unparalleled support”, extending the grace period for some types of vehicles and groups, including disabled people, and offering more free bus passes.He said it would be “complemented by significant improvements to the outer London bus network, making public transport a more attractive alternative to the car”.",

In Madrid, a 32% fall in NO2 concentrations was observed after an LEZ was introduced in 2018.In the UK, a public consultation launched by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, on expanding the city’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) to cover the entire capital next year is due to conclude at the end of July.Jemima Hartshorn, the founder of Mums for Lungs, told the Guardian: “We’ve just seen how effective the London Ulez has been at reducing air pollution. There has been a 20% drop in NO2 since the zone was expanded. It’s great to hear a growing number of other European cities are also taking air quality seriously.”Italy tops Europe’s clean air table, with 172 declared clean air zones, compared with 78 in Germany, 17 in the UK, 14 in the Netherlands and 8 in France.",

The policy was originally drawn up under the previous mayor, Boris Johnson, covering the capital’s central congestion zone. Sadiq Khan extended it in October 2021 to cover most inner boroughs, out to a boundary of the north and south circular roads.How does it work?The oldest, most polluting vehicles have to pay a daily charge to drive in the zone – £12.50 for cars and more for older coaches and lorries – although the majority of cars are exempt.Why is it so controversial now?Khan intends to expand it to cover all of Greater London in August. More people in outer London boroughs – and those living just outside the capital who drive in – are dependent on cars, with fewer public transport options, and can be charged for essential journeys. Diesel drivers in particular are aggrieved, as some of the non-compliant cars and vans could be less than 10 years old and were once seen as efficient, but are now known to be highly polluting since the dieselgate scandal.How do people know if their vehicle is liable for the charge?They can check it on Transport for London’s website by entering the registration number. Broadly, only petrol cars older than 2005 or diesels registered before 2015 are liable.Why is Khan pressing ahead?He argues that air pollution is a public health emergency, and that there are 4,000 premature deaths a year from toxic air in the capital. Most people in central London do not own cars, and TfL claim that 9 out of 10 cars will not be charged. The significant expansion of Ulez in 2021 has been accepted. Cities around the country have been told they need to enforce clean air zones by the government.What can people do if they own a non-compliant vehicle?London is running a £110m scrappage scheme which will pay owners of non-compliant cars up to £2,000 if they are on lower incomes or benefits. Sole traders, small businesses and charities can receive up to £9,500 for upgrading vans.",

It’s a truly excellent combo that has to be tried, so next time you roast some pork, make extra and save it for this dish. Shred the pork and reheat in a frying pan until it’s hot right through, then put in a warmed burger bun and top with a spoonful of kimchi.Brussel’s sprouts are like whole mini cabbages, and make a really cute and seasonal festive kimchi. Once the kimchi has started to ferment, you can leave it on the counter to ferment some more, or put it in the fridge, which will slow down the process. Either way, it should keep for months, if not years. It should be out of direct sunlight and prefers to be in a cool, dark cupboard where the temperature is more stable. Do watch out for mould, though; if any forms on the top, put the lot in the food waste bin. You can help prevent mould by making sure the vegetables are all submerged in the liquid – just press them down with a fork, and if need be keep them down with a weight.Kimchi is often made with rice flour, which is made into a porridge and mixed with pureed onion, garlic, fish sauce and Korean chilli flakes (gochugaru) or gochujang. As a wholefood cook, however, I like to use brown rice, so I have suggested making your own brown rice flour for this recipe. It’s much easier than you might think, but does require a high-speed blender or spice grinder. Regular white rice flour will work fine, though, as will wheat flour and gluten-free flour.",

When they shrink, glaciers release larger amounts of freshwater into the sea which can disrupt the currents of the Southern Ocean.Dr Benjamin Davison, an expert in Earth observation and the study’s lead, said: “There is a mixed picture of ice-shelf deterioration, and this is to do with the ocean temperature and ocean currents around Antarctica.“The western half is exposed to warm water, which can rapidly erode the ice shelves from below, whereas much of east Antarctica is currently protected from nearby warm water by a band of cold water at the coast.”Scientists measured year-by-year changes to the ice using satellites that can see through the thick cloud during long polar nights.Researchers looked at more than 100,000 images taken from space to analyse the health of the ice shelves, which can have knock-on effects for the rest of the globe, and published their findings in the journal Scientific Advances.The estimated 67tn tonnes of freshwater released into the ocean over the 25-year period affects the ocean currents that transport heat and nutrients around the world.Scientists believe the ice loss is a result of the climate crisis because there would be more ice regrowing if it was part of a cycle of natural variation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

The true figure is likely significantly higher, as reservoir data for tens of thousands of smaller dams is not available.Land submerged by dams is in addition to more than 2bn acres – the equivalent of 97% of tribal territory taken through treaties, laws, purchases, violence and coercion since the arrival of colonial settlers more than 500 years ago.“This is the first study to quantify tribal land flooded by dams, which is an overlooked and additional source of Native land dispossession,” said the lead author Heather Randell, assistant professor of rural sociology and demography at Penn State University. “There was a lot of immediate trauma caused by the flooding and many long term impacts for tribal members that continue today.”There are more 90,000 6ft or taller dams in the US, of which 2% are megadams rising over 100ft, according to the Army Corps of Engineers’ data.",

But all of this will be paid for by increased customer bills.The report being withheld from publication predicted the state of the privatised water industry today, and warned against private equity being allowed to move into water firms.It was prepared for the Competition Commission (now the Competition and Markets Authority, CMA) in 2002 and has never been published in full. It should have been released under the 20-year rule last summer, but despite repeated attempts to have it published it is being kept secret.Today, as private equity dominates ownership of the water sector in England, bringing with it high levels of debt and underinvestment leading to sewage pollution, water shortages and leaks, the author of the report has called for full disclosure of his warning two decades ago.Sewage pollution being discharged into rivers was a major issue in the May 2023 English local elections.

Urban water demand is predicted to increase by 80% by 2050.Water shortages are also becoming a more frequent occurrence in rural areas, the report found. Currently, between 2 billion and 3 billion people experience water shortages for at least a month a year.Audrey Azoulay, director general of Unesco, the UN agency that produced the report, said governments must cooperate over water. “There is an urgent need to establish strong international mechanisms to prevent the global water crisis from spiralling out of control. Water is our common future, and it is essential to act together to share it equitably and manage it sustainably,” she said.The UN is holding its first water conference since 1977 in New York this week, co-hosted by the governments of the Netherlands and Tajikistan, at which global water issues will be discussed by ministers and a small number of heads of state from around the world. They will hear warnings of a looming water crisis, which has been largely neglected by governments.About 2 billion people globally do not have safe drinking water, while 3.6 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation, according to the report.Water use has been growing globally by about 1% a year for the last 40 years and this will continue, driven by population growth and development. About a 10th of the global population live in countries with high water stress.But experts told the Guardian that governments were failing to take the water crisis seriously.

And that’s where the urban model comes into play.”The starting point for the research was a plan, launched by Barcelona officials in the Eixample district in 2020, to swap out car-clogged intersections for plant-filled spaces that prioritise pedestrians and cyclists. Known as Green Axes, or Eixos Verds in Catalan, the plan ultimately envisions turning one out of every three streets across the city into a green zone.Researchers calculated that the plan, if fully implemented, could boost green space across the city by 5.7%. Using a framework established by previous studies that linked green spaces to mental health, they crunched the numbers on the potential impact of the Barcelona plan.“What we found was that – even though we’re only increasing the green [space] by about 5 or 6% – you get quite a considerable reduction in the number of cases of mental health problems,” said Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, a co-author of the paper, also with the Barcelona institute.Their modelling estimated that the surge in vegetation could prevent as many as 31,000 cases of “poor mental health”, decrease the number of visits to mental health specialists by 13% and reduce the use of tranquillisers and sedatives by 8% annually. The result could translate to savings of as much as €45m a year in direct and indirect mental health costs.",

Calculations by Oxfam, the Stockholm Environment Institute and others reveal that the richest 1% produced as much carbon pollution in one year as the 5 billion people who make up the poorest two-thirds of humanity. Though they number just 2,600, the combined wealth of the world’s billionaires is greater than the GDP of all but two countries – the US and China. The impact on the environment of their carbon‑intensive behaviour is colossal.But as this week’s Guardian series, the great carbon divide, has shown, outsized emissions are not only the work of this minority of the ultra-wealthy. Nor are they confined to the far larger number of individuals with a net worth of at least $1m, combined with energy‑intensive lifestyles, who social scientist Dario Kenner calls the “polluter elite”. In fact, half of all emissions are produced by the top 10% – that is, the much bigger group of about 800 million people who earn at least $40,000. While in their own countries these people are regarded as middle income or middle class, their consumption and emissions far outstrip those of 90% of the world’s inhabitants.The environment movement has largely sought to avoid personalising the world’s carbon problem for the good reason that this plays into the hands of oil and gas producers (whether businesses or governments). The framing of global heating as primarily an issue for consumers, rather than politicians, was what lay behind BP’s creation of the carbon footprint calculator. But while lifestyle changes must not be allowed to distract from the role of governments in moving away from fossil fuels, they are too important to be ignored. Instead, policymakers of all kinds should acknowledge their role in guiding and enforcing greener choices.To give an example: two-thirds of Norwegian households have heat pumps due to taxes on carbon heating and their government’s decision to train a workforce to install them. Norway, of course, is a small and wealthy country.",

Wildlife campaigners say it is “unacceptable” that ministers have “ignored the science” and allowed the use of these dangerous chemicals.The matter was discussed at the latest meeting of the government’s expert committee on pesticides on 12 September. While the pesticide has been banned in the EU for years, it was allowed for emergency use until this year, when it was banned entirely. Now the UK has left the EU it is able to make its own rules on pesticides. Recent research found that 36 pesticides banned by the EU are not ruled out for use in the UK.The pesticides are toxic for bees but are also, at certain levels, toxic to aquatic life, and build up in river systems.New research by the Rivers Trust and Wildlife and Countryside Link (WCL) found that one or more of five neonicotinoids – four of which are banned in the EU – were found in more than one in 10 English river sites tested by the Environment Agency (29 of 283 sites). At 55% of these 29 sites one or more neonicotinoids were above the EU’s proposed environmental quality standard (EQS) – the level deemed safe for aquatic wildlife. Twenty one per cent of sites had one or more toxic pesticide at over four times the safe level.Rivers most affected by the pesticides were found in the east of England, south-east England and West Midlands in rivers including the Ivel, Waveney, Nene, Ouse and Tame.Barnaby Coupe, the land use policy manager at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “This research reveals that our rivers and waterways are plagued by a cocktail of neonicotinoid pesticides, despite these chemicals being banned since 2018.“It is completely unacceptable that the government is allowing these chemicals to pollute the environment when the evidence for the disastrous impact of neonicotinoids grows year on year.",

The review of the UK’s net zero strategy by the former energy minister Chris Skidmore, as well as parliamentary committees, recommended bringing in such a ban from 2025, but the practice will be allowed to continue until at least 2030.Offshore operators waste enough gas to power more than 750,000 homes a year through flaring and venting, and enough to power at least 100,000 more from undetected leaks.Measures to cut the UK’s methane in line with the pledge and beyond are still possible, according to the Green Alliance. Bringing forward the ban on flaring and venting, forcing landfill operators to capture methane at a higher rate than what escapes from rubbish dumps at present, mending the UK’s existing leaky gas mains at a faster rate, and encouraging a swifter uptake of methane-suppressing feed for livestock could help the country achieve a reduction of more than 40% by 2030.Liam Hardy, of the Green Alliance, said: “Existing measures to tackle UK methane emissions are wholly inadequate, but it’s not too late to turn things around.

Despite the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, having changed planning rules introduced in 2015 by the then prime minister, David Cameron, to stop onshore wind projects being blocked by a single objection, they still face higher barriers than every other form of infrastructure, including waste incinerators.Analysis of the government’s renewable energy planning database shows that no applications for new onshore wind projects have been submitted since the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, claimed that the government would overturn the onshore wind ban in September 2023.At the time, the National Infrastructure Commission advised the government to go further and restore onshore wind to the government’s Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects process, which would encourage more applications.The government rejected this recommendation and said the measures announced in September were enough.Analysis by Carbon Brief estimates that if onshore wind had continued to be built at the same rate it was in 2017 – before the ban started to come into effect – 7GW of onshore wind would have been built. This would have knocked £5.1bn off energy bills, or £182 for each UK household, in the year from July 2022 to June 2023.Greenpeace UK’s policy director, Doug Parr, said: “As predicted, the government’s futile planning tweaks amounted to absolutely nothing and the de facto ban is still well and truly in place. Why would a developer risk putting their cash behind a project that remains beholden to woolly guidelines and the unworkable decisions made by some local councils?“Onshore wind is the cheapest, quickest and greenest way to produce energy.

Charger companies have more investment coming in than they can put to work, but problems may remain where local authorities are slow to act, he said.Chris Pateman-Jones, chief executive of Connected Kerb, which plans to install 190,000 on-street chargers by 2030, said he expected a further significant increase in charger numbers during 2023, but “much more needs to be done if the country is to be EV-ready for 2030”.Local authorities need to install “hundreds, even thousands, of charging points in their area – not just a handful”, while central government also has a role to play in locations such as NHS sites, he said.“Scale remains the greatest challenge facing the EV industry, but installing in the right places where there is the greatest need is also critical,” he said. “Collaboration between central government, local authorities, businesses and charging point operators is a prerequisite to unlocking the funding needed for a full transition, as is winning the hearts and minds of local communities about the benefits of electric vehicles.",

There she became the UCLA’s first female physics instructor, described in the newspapers as a “25-year-old striking blue-eyed blonde”.Returning to her native England, she taught at Chelsea College of Science and Technology (now part of King’s College London), where she met her husband, Heinz Post, who set up a department for the history of the philosophy of science. The couple married in 1961, after which Janet moved to the Sir John Cass College (now part of London Metropolitan University) in Aldgate, where she is remembered as a first-class physics lecturer with an ability to engage with and inspire students.In 1973 Janet and Heinz had a holiday cottage built in Switzerland, where they would go for summer holidays and winter skiing, as well as visiting friends in Europe.Janet was also a successful textbook author. In 1979, Heinz took a sabbatical year, which the couple spent in the US. Janet used the time to write Energy: A Guidebook. It was ahead of its time in including three chapters on renewable energy. Published by Oxford University Press in 1983, it sold more than 23,000 copies.In the 1990s she used her skills at the Open University (OU) to help a team including myself to create a resource pack for university lecturers to teach renewable energy. She contributed chapters to the successful OU textbooks Renewable Energy (1996) and Energy Systems and Sustainability (2003). She was particularly skilful at devising the student questions and answers, and the exam papers.

Of these, 75 were identified as Hyundai-branded.The arrival in recent years of hydraulic excavators in the Brazilian Amazon has dramatically accelerated the expansion of illegal gold mining there. One of these machines can in 24 hours perform work that would take three men 40 days to complete, the report said.This increased efficiency is pushing wildcat miners ever deeper into supposedly protected areas of the forest in search of new gold deposits, said Danicley de Aguiar, senior forest campaigner at Greenpeace Brazil.The Guardian saw diggers wrecking Yanomami land last December.

I had the pleasure of meeting Caroline Lucas when I chaired an address she gave to the Quaker Socialist Society several years ago. One of the strongest elements of her political career is that she took up the tools and instruments that women and men fought for, even died for, over many years: the right to vote but also the right to be elected, and from this, the right to shape the laws and conduct of a country, and to bring about true equality and democracy through strong legislation.I understand why people choose to demonstrate, to form pressure groups, to campaign through social media. Yet, election to office is surely the wise way to change the world, with the tools bequeathed to us by the brave of the past. To abolish slavery, to gain votes for women, to outlaw racial prejudice or disrespect for homosexuality, the sure and final step is to legislate. As one who has modestly stood for and sometimes gained office, may I beg all those who seek to change life for the better to at least consider candidacy. It is your own personal and valuable bequest.Ian Flintoff Former parliamentary candidate and borough councillor, Oxford In October 2014, I wrote a letter to the Guardian saying that Caroline Lucas “is widely regarded as the most effective opposition MP.

The problem was actually building the batteries.The company’s efforts have now come to nothing. It collapsed into administration on Tuesday after funding talks failed, leaving a string of disappointed backers ranging from the FTSE 100 companies Glencore and Ashtead to the property investor Tritax, owned by investment group abrdn, which had committed to fund a battery “gigafactory” in Northumberland.Some of the investors are sanguine. Britishvolt – with no customers and no ready product – was always “something of a lottery ticket”, said one, who joined before the Guardian revealed a funding crunch that forced Britishvolt to put the project on “life support” last summer. The bigger investors have lost millions of pounds, but not enough to make a material impact on their balance sheets.It is the UK government that must now answer some big questions about the future of the British car industry. In January 2022 Boris Johnson hailed the “EV battery pioneer” for planning to create “thousands of jobs”. Less than a year later, Johnson is out of Downing Street, Britishvolt is bankrupt, and the future of the UK car industry is under serious threat.The British industry is painfully reliant on producing cars with petrol or diesel engines, but it still has a shot at retooling for the battery age. The one shining example is the Chinese-owned Envision AESC. It is working on a “gigafactory” in Sunderland, with 38 gigawatt hours (GWh) of annual output to supply the Japanese carmaker Nissan next door. Envision managers estimate that 100GWh would be enough to attract a full supply chain and its well-paid jobs to the UK.Britishvolt’s failure could give Tata group, the Indian owner of Jaguar Land Rover, a stronger hand in negotiations over where it builds its battery factory. Tata Motors’ chief financial officer, P.B. Balaji, last week said the company would make batteries in Europe – a disconcertingly vague promise for UK officials desperate for more gigafactories.",

This is one that continues to fly beneath the radar and requires serious action from the government at all levels.According to the European Environment Agency, noise pollution is the second largest environmental threat to health, causing 12,000 premature deaths a year. Indeed, at Heathrow, at least 725,000 people are currently exposed to aircraft noise, with that figure expected to more than double should a third runway ever be built.While there is certainly a financial issue with regard to the ability to mitigate the impact of aircraft noise, or indeed move away from it entirely, the fact is that aircraft noise causes health problems for all. Worryingly, many people may not even be aware of it until the damage has been done.The delivery of an airspace modernisation programme over the next few years will see changes to flight paths across the country that will increase the intensity of noise for overflown communities and is likely to expose many communities to aircraft noise for the first time.Academic research has consistently shown that aircraft noise affects people’s health at lower decibel levels than previously thought, and that people are becoming more sensitive to aircraft noise to a greater extent than other modes of transport.The fault ultimately lies at the feet of the government for the glacial pace of progress in addressing the problem of noise, despite the recognition of its harm to health. One simple solution exists to help local communities and that is to make aircraft noise a statutory nuisance.Paul BeckfordHeathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise I completely agree with Coco Khan’s article and the insensitivity of people in urban residential areas who contribute inconsiderate additional noise pollution to the environment.

This was alleviated by roots – turnips, carrots and parsnips – grown by Protestant refugees from the low countries who settled initially in East Anglia and Kent, bringing with them expertise in commercial gardening.Roots were shipped to London from the East Anglian ports of Yarmouth, Colchester and Norwich in each of the three worst years of dearth. Nearer London, root production was developing; in the late 1590s, the herbalist John Gerard wrote: “The small Turnep groweth by Hackney, in a sandy ground, and those that are brought to Cheap-side market from that village are the best that ever I tasted.” On the other side of London, roots were grown in quantity in Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea.By the 1630s, this area was said to furnish “the Cittys of London Westminster and places adjacent … with above fower and twenty thousand loads yearly of rootes”. As far as cooking went, these early consumers were unimaginative.",

Now, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) has found that most climate denial videos on YouTube push the idea that climate solutions do not work, climate science and the climate movement are unreliable, or that the effects of global heating are beneficial or harmless.Researchers from the CCDH gathered a dataset of text transcripts from 12,058 climate-related YouTube videos posted by 96 channels over almost six years from 1 January 2018 to 30 September 2023. They also included the results of a nationally representative survey conducted by polling company Survation which found 31% of UK respondents aged 13 to 17 agreed with the statement “Climate change and its effects are being purposefully overexaggerated”. This rose to 37% of teenagers categorised as heavy users of social media, meaning they reported using any one platform for more than four hours a day.The report published on Tuesday shows a shift from the “old denial” – that climate change is not happening or not anthropogenic – to the “new denial”.These new denial narratives that question the science and solutions for climate change constituted 35% of all climate denial on YouTube in 2018, but now represent the large majority (70%). Over the same period, the share of old denial has dropped from 65% to 30% of total claims.The report authors believe that this shift is because the scientific evidence is now more accepted and hard to dispute, so those aiming to win people over to climate denial and delay must discredit the solutions and people pushing for climate action.Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the CCDH, said: “Scientists have won the battle to inform the public about climate change and its causes, which is why those opposed to climate action have cynically switched focus to undermining confidence in solutions and in science itself.",

Also known as the plum pudding pig, it has distinctive spots and is often illustrated in children’s books. The list shows that the number of dams producing pedigree progeny has fallen 32% since 2020.The number of British Landrace dams producing pedigree piglets has plummeted by more than 95% since 2006. Photograph: Andia/UIG/Getty ImagesThe pink British Landrace pig breed was already in the RBST watchlist’s most urgent priority category, and has seen a dramatic decline with just 23 dams producing pedigree progeny in 2022, down from 43 in 2021. This compares with 495 dams registered in 2006.The RBST chief executive, Christopher Price, said: “The British Landrace is in a particularly worrying situation. It is a fantastic breed for really high quality bacon and pork production, very easy to manage and excellent for improving other breeds of pig. But it is not as well known as some of our other native pig breeds. We are working with the British Pig Association and the small but dedicated community of British Landrace keepers to make sure the breed’s excellent attributes aren’t overlooked, as well as ramping up support for conservation and breeding programmes.”The list shows that other native pig breeds, including the British Saddleback, Gloucestershire Old Spot and Middle White, are breeding less.Price added: “The crisis in the pig industry over the past two years is driving a very worrying and worsening situation for several of our rare native breeds.",

It does not comment on the climate policies of individual nations, but Skea’s comments on Monday clearly indicate that the recent actions of the UK government has slowed climate action, despite IPCC scientists warning of “a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all”.Rishi Sunak weakened or abolished a number of green measures recently, including pushing back a ban on the sale of new petrol cars from 2030 to 2035. The UK also approved the exploitation of the large Rosebank oil field near Shetland on Wednesday.Asked about these changes, Skea said: “We don’t comment on individual country’s policies, but, obviously, the more [oil and gas] you add to the reserves, the greater the percentage you would need to leave in the ground to stay within carbon budgets.”‘He is making the UK a climate villain’: MEPs denounce Sunak’s net zero retreatRead more“The conclusion [of the IPCC’s 2022 report] was that to limit warming to 2C [above pre-industrial levels], 30% of oil, 50% of gas reserves and 80% of current coal reserves would need to remain in the ground,” he said. To keep below 1.5C and avoid the worst climate impacts, 60% of oil and gas and 90% of coal reserves need to remain unburned, according to a 2021 report.Postponing climate action leads to bigger increases in global temperature rise, Skea said: “What determines global warming is not the timing of net zero, but the pathway by which you get there.",

This inaccurate characterisation sowed discord within communities. A lot of people care about our street trees and gave their time and energy to try to protect them for the benefit of the whole city.”The council accepts it repeatedly gave out misleading information about the 25-year contract it signed with the outsourcing firm Amey.“We are sorry for developing and adopting a flawed plan and including the aim to replace half of the city’s street trees,” said Hunt and Josephs. “We would like in particular to apologise for repeatedly saying in the media, and in correspondence, that there was no target for the tree replacement programme, that felling was always a last resort and that any change to the tree replacement programme would result in catastrophic costs. It is clear that this was not the case.”The pair said the plan involved “the removal of healthy trees which should still be standing today”.They wrote: “These healthy trees were important to residents and gave communities and the city benefits which were overlooked.

This is more than in most European countries, such as France, Spain and Germany, where the amount is about 120-130 litres per person.However, critics have argued that water companies should be taking measures to retain water supplies, such as fixing leaks and building reservoirs, before focusing on individual use.The regulator has said that rather than charging a flat standard amount based on the type of property, or a flat rate based on how much water it is used, a more dynamic pricing structure is needed.It has recommended water companies adopt trials of seasonal charging to help lower water bills in the winter, reducing bills for homes with water butts and permeable driveways, which can help to reduce the risk of flooding and pollution to rivers and bathing water, and charging more for water at peak times.Ofwat said successful trials of these charging methods could be rolled out to all households in a given area.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They also reported a lack of social contact, so were less able to discuss problems with peers.Rural areas also face relative poverty, and farmers have had to face particular stresses recently, the report says, including unpredictable weather and animal health crises. The report has found the UK farming community has lower levels of mental wellbeing than the population at large.MPs also highlighted changing and uncertain government policies that can affect their incomes as well as mental health. Respondents said uncertainty around the new environmental land management schemes, which replace EU subsidies for farmers, has led to mental distress.They have called for a more joined-up approach, pointing out that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) does not seem to have prioritised rural mental health in its policies.The report says: “Defra is clearly responsible for working with the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) to ensure mental health policy and services are rural proofed, it is unclear what priority, resources and energy Defra has assigned to achieving impact in this area.” They recommend that the two departments work on a rural mental health policy.The MPs said Defra, DHSC, the NHS and the Department for Transport should set out rural transport policies that provide rural communities with access to health services as good as the access urban communities enjoy.The chair of the environment, food and rural affairs committee, Sir Robert Goodwill, said: “Rural communities face a unique set of challenges.

Wissing’s transport ministry has not yet officially replied to the proposal.To the surprise of its own members, the German Green party had remained relatively reserved in the debate over the combustion engine – until this week, when Habeck’s intervention raised the temperature in Berlin’s seats of power.",

The report adds that “access to green space must be a priority in a land use framework, and provision and maintenance of accessible green space must also be strengthened in existing policies”.The report suggests using the green belt to expand access to green space. Matthew Kirby, a PhD researcher at Northumbria University, told the report that – when viewed through a natural capital lens – green belt areas have the potential to deliver significant multifunctional land uses, including carbon sequestration, flood management and recreation.The Green MP Caroline Lucas recently tabled a private member’s bill asking for the green belt to be open for the public, arguing it is near urban centres where many people do not have natural areas nearby.The report was also highly critical of the UK farming system. Jake Fiennes, the director of Holkham nature reserve in Norfolk, told the commission that “current agricultural and farming practices are generally unsustainable for the medium to long term. Our reliance on synthetic inputs and the effects they have on the wider environment are all too clear.”The report criticises the government for uncertainty around the post-Brexit farming payments, which were supposed to deliver nature recovery.

But the term forgotten veg also covers those not-at-their-best specimens at the back of the fridge, such as limp lettuce and borderline beets, all of which can be turned into delicious soup.Forgotten vegetable soupIf we want to save food from being wasted, it is imperative that we learn at least in part to cook without strict recipes, inventing delicious dishes from leftovers and past-its-best produce. In my cookbook Eating for Pleasure, People & Planet, I lay out a root-to-fruit manifesto, a value-based approach to eating for personal and planetary health that’s based on science. Point one of that manifesto, however, is “Eat for pleasure”. How can a diet be sustainable if we don’t want to eat it the next day, after all? Point two is “Cook with love, confidence and creativity”, by which I mean that we need to embrace our inner chef, cook what we love and come up with delicious dishes made with whatever we have to hand. Keep it simple and you can’t go far wrong. Most ingredients go well together in simple combinations, even if unexpected: some of my favourite partnerships I discovered through experimentation, such as squash and orange, mushroom and vanilla, and parsnip and curry.All the ingredients mentioned in the “recipe” below, which is less a set of instructions than a general template and guide, are approximate and optional, and the amount used of any of them can be tweaked according to your preferences and the availability of ingredients. These quantities will make one 300-500ml portion of soup, so multiply the quantities by the number of mouths you want to feed. I always advise making more, anyway, because batch cooking saves energy and means you’ve got meals in the fridge or freezer for the week (or months) ahead.Serves 1Choose your style Decide on the type of soup you’d like to make – refined, chunky or blended – then cut your veg accordingly (ie, diced small or large).",

One in four homes with gas cookers breached hourly pollution levels set by the World Health Organization, while none of the homes in the control group, which used electric cookers, broke the limits.Piet Jacobs, a scientist from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, said: “Changing to electric cooking – preferably combined with use of well-designed ventilation hoods to reduce exposure to high levels of particulate matter from cooking – can bring these values down to below recommended levels.”Burning gas to cook food releases pollutants such as NO2 that hurt lungs and inflame airways. Scientists have long known of an association between gas cookers and childhood asthma, though they have not proved a causal link between the two.Indoor wood burning raises women’s lung cancer risk by 43%, says US studyRead moreThe report, which was commissioned by the energy efficiency group Clasp, measured indoor NO2 levels in seven European countries. The scientists chose homes in which people did not smoke, and that were far from busy roads and factories, to reduce the effect of other sources of pollution.They found pollution spikes could last several hours and were more intense the longer people cooked. On average, the WHO daily limit for NO2 pollution was breached for 3.25 days over the 13-day testing period.“This is a key study that will facilitate raising awareness and triggering action that will protect the health of those most vulnerable, like our children,” said Juana María Delgado-Saborit, the head of the environmental health research lab at Jaume I University in Spain, who served as an external reviewer for the study.She said the biggest limitation of the study was that the researchers had to use sensors, which did not perform as well as the scientific instruments used to measure air quality in laboratories or outdoors.",

I duly trundled along and asked about the enormous dividend paid by the most polluting water company in England last year. Lo and behold, the main problems lie with Ofwat, which insists that it keeps prices low, and with shareholders, who demand an enormous payout.Then came what was, apparently, the clincher – “We have spent £XYZ million...” – a tactic much loved by Conservative frontbenchers, ie provide a meaningless sum instead of telling us what proportion of the amount that should have been spent was achieved. I suppose I was meant to be grateful that United Utilities is going to open an information centre in Windermere to tell us what it is doing. That money would be better spent reducing pensioners’ bills.The sad thing is that the public appears to bathe in apathy. Perhaps we should resurrect the spirit of the poll tax demonstrators and cancel our direct debits to the water companies.Gwyn JonesWindermere, Cumbria Your editorial (21 May) drew attention to the failings of privatised water companies and called for change, either by reforming the regulatory framework, or through renationalisation. The 1989 privatisation of the water industry in England and Wales was a response to the failure to invest in maintaining the nationalised industry’s assets. The regulatory regime introduced at that time addressed these problems by creating an independent regulator, Ofwat.For perhaps the first 15 years, it could reasonably be claimed that privatisation had been successful. But more recently, yardstick competition between water companies, enabling Ofwat to set demanding targets based on best practice, has been weakened as ownership has passed increasingly to financial institutions more focused on returns than improving efficiency or service.Incentives for water firms to act responsibly have been weakened as responsibility for monitoring sewage discharges has passed from the Environment Agency (EA) to the firms themselves, while the EA’s environmental protection budget fell by about two-thirds between 2010 and 2019.Reform should involve restoring the EA’s responsibility and resources.",

We know extreme heat is going to get worse, and additional research will help us better quantify future change.”The fingerprint of climate change is being identified across the planet. The risk of extreme drought across California and Nevada was made six times worse by the climate crisis and a strong periodical La Niña climate event from October 2020 to September 2021, while, conversely, extreme rainfall that deluged parts of the UK in May 2021 was 1.5 times more likely due to global heating.A severe hot spell in China in February 2021 was made between four and 20 times more likely because of human-caused climate change, while acute drought in Iran, which it experienced in 2021, is now 50% more likely because of the greenhouse gases humanity has pumped into the atmosphere.A swath of other severe impacts can be attributed, at least in part, to the influence of the climate crisis, including the weather that caused a dangerous wildfire in Cape Town, South Africa, in 2021 to be 90% more likely than if we had never heated up the planet and even the persistent cloudiness over the Tibetan plateau that reduced vegetation growth, caused, researchers say, by elevated global temperatures along with abnormal winds and localized pollution.",

Males can weigh up to 600g, and grow to the size of a small domestic cat.Researchers tracked northern quolls during seven weeks of the breeding season, using accelerometers contained in miniature felt backpacks.Their study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, found that male quolls rested for only about 8% of the time, while females spent three times as long (24% of the time) resting. The team retrieved data from seven males and six females.The male quolls also spent more time on the move. Two males the researchers named Moimoi and Cayless travelled 10.4km and 9.4km respectively in one night – the human equivalent of walking around 35 to 40km, they estimate.“The males are investing all this energy into … looking for the females, because that’s how they maximise their reproductive output.

This report shows that we must move away from these mega-vehicles if we are to achieve the GFEI goal of doubling the fuel efficiency of cars by 2030. Vehicle size matters – and in this case bigger is definitely not better.”The reduction in emissions from the motor industry has been driven by an uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), which reached 15% of market share in 2022.

Its stated aim is to establishing whether these methods are selective, with the eventual goal, hunting organisations hope, of allowing them to continue.Hunters are being allowed to catch 6,000 skylarks using pantes (horizontal nets) or matoles (drop cages) in four departments in south-west France and 500 lapwings and 15 golden plovers in the Ardennes in the north-east.Allain Bougrain-Dubourg, the president of the French Bird Protection League (LPO), said: “This determination to encourage non-selective trapping is unworthy of a country that claims to be a leader in the recovery of biodiversity … it’s clear the matoles trap a multitude of protected species, and are not selective. Even if the birds are released, they are at best stressed, at worst subjected to mistreatment that is unacceptable in the 21st century.”France’s State Council previously outlawed these trapping methods, stating there was “a serious doubt about whether they conform to European legal rules”.The EU has opened proceedings against Malta, which has used the same “experimental” justification for allowing the trapping of finches, and a court hearing is expected early next year.Yves Verilhac, a former director general of the LPO and lifelong bird protection campaigner, added: “They have taken the pretext of science for allowing this. It may be only a few thousand birds, but these are species whose numbers are dwindling and these methods have been banned.“We have reported the government once again to the European court in the hope they will start imposing fines.",

A “strong signal to energy markets” was needed, said Fatih Birol – one which indicated that governments are taking the climate seriously. Wealthy countries, he added, having disproportionately contributed to historical carbon emissions, bear a special responsibility as the climate begins to change at “frightening speed”.On Wednesday Britain certainly sent out a signal. But it was hardly the one the IEA would have hoped for. Instead, the green light was given for the exploitation of the United Kingdom’s largest untapped oilfield. The Rosebank project in the North Sea has the potential to deliver 500m barrels of oil, which, when burned, would emit the same amount of carbon dioxide as the running of 56 coal-fired power stations for a year. Tax incentives offered to the Norwegian energy company Equinor will effectively subsidise a development certain to undermine the country’s credibility in future climate negotiations.About 80% of North Sea oil is sold abroad, giving the lie to ministerial arguments that this is about energy security for hard-pressed Britons. So why? The truth is that, as with the U-turns last week on net zero-related targets, Rishi Sunak is playing politics with the climate emergency. The prime minister calculates that, in the context of the cost of living crisis, the challenges of the green transition can become a wedge issue with Labour. For presumed short-term electoral gain, he is methodically disrupting a formerly broad consensus on climate commitments.Domestically, this cynical disregard for the UK’s environmental responsibilities will leave future governments to pick up the pieces. That is deeply irresponsible. It is also to squander the possibilities of economic growth that come with the net zero timetable, which is defining the industrial parameters of the future. While fiscal inducements are deployed in the North Sea, undermining climate targets that command popular assent, insufficient government support this month caused off-shore wind sector growth to grind disastrously to a halt. A dismal combination of political opportunism and economic myopia is sabotaging Britain’s green prospects.But it is on the global stage that the Rosebank decision will resonate most damagingly.",

The company, one of the world’s largest investors in renewable power, will do so by growing its renewables portfolio with the development of a new onshore windfarm in Scotland, which is due to begin generating electricity from 2026.The estate manager has bought renewable electricity for the business district from energy suppliers since 2012 but the deal with Brookfield is the first time it will source its clean electricity directly from a renewable energy project.The 15-year agreement could be extended to supply all of Canary Wharf’s 18m sq ft of office, retail and leisure spaces with 100% renewable electricity, according to Shobi Khan, the chief executive of Canary Wharf Group.Khan told the Guardian that the deal took three years to agree but should help to reduce electricity bills by about 50% compared with using power generated by gas power plants. The deal is part of a wider campaign to transform the estate into a sustainability leader, he said.“The point is to not only do something good for the environment but have it make good business sense, too,” Khan added.",

        "text": "A list of the 20 costliest climate disasters of 2023 has revealed a “global postcode lottery stacked against the poor”, according to an analysis.The research by the charity Christian Aid found that devastating wildfires and floods are hitting those who can least afford to rebuild, and the countries that have contributed least to the climate crisis by burning far fewer fossil fuels than wealthy nations, which have faced fewer climate disasters.The cost ranges from more than $4,000 (£3,155) per person due to a wildfire in Hawaiito $9 (£7) per person due to flooding in Peru.The research examined 20 natural disasters exacerbated by climate breakdown that hit 14 countries over the past year. The highest per capita cost was the wildfires in Hawaii in August, which far outstrips the second costliest, which was Guam’s storms in May, at a cost of nearly $1,500 (£1,182) per person.The analysis published on Wednesday highlights that countries with worse infrastructure and flimsier homes face larger costs after a climate disaster as their inhabited areas are more easily destroyed. In the areas where people have faced the highest costs, many are employed in agriculture, which is vulnerable to extreme weather, and the government is less likely to invest in prevention or rebuilding.Patrick Watt, the chief executive of Christian Aid, said: “When it comes to the climate crisis, there is a global postcode lottery that is stacked against the poor. In poorer countries, people are often less prepared for climate-related disasters and have fewer resources with which to bounce back. The upshot is that more people die, and recovery is slower and more unequal. There is a double injustice in the fact that the communities worst affected by global warming have contributed little to the problem.“Governments urgently need to take further action at home and internationally, to cut emissions, and adapt to the effects of climate change. And where the impacts go beyond what people can adapt to, the loss and damage fund must be resourced to compensate the poorest countries for the effects of a crisis that isn’t of their making.",

The marine pests, which they have renamed “naked clams”, are nutritious, high in vitamin B12, and require only wood and water to grow.It’s wonderful news. We desperately need sustainable sources of protein: meat is responsible for nearly 60% of greenhouse gases from food production, while industrial fish farming has huge environmental costs.For a number of years in the mid-2010s, my partner became obsessed with the idea that over the course of our lifetimes we would all end up eating insects. He had read an article about a London restaurant that served crickets, and sounded thrilled by the prospect, although for one reason or another we never made it there. This didn’t stop him from expounding the benefits of tail-to-tentacle eating to anyone who would listen.This all changed when we went to Thailand earlier this year. We visited a night market that served a selection of local delicacies: fried grasshoppers, scorpions, stag beetles on sticks. To my horror, he returned from the stall with a paper tray filled with oily, glistening crickets. “It’s the future of meat,” he said. “It’s lean protein.” The moment he crunched on the first one, his face froze. “It’s very… insect-like. There’s no meat on it. All you can taste is legs and wings.” He struggled through a third of the portion before admitting defeat.Maybe naked clams are the future. Perhaps with the right recipe and flavour pairing they could become the next calamari rings. The pictures, unfortunately, are not appetising. There is a reason why most cultures have a taboo around eating insects, and why we pay despicable politicians millions of pounds to eat camel udders. We can intellectualise it all we want, but food also needs to be appealing. It will take some real ingenuity from chefs to make worms palatable to the public. In the meantime, pass the vegetables.Nepos everywhereView image in fullscreenSusan Sarandon with her son Jack Henry Robbins at the 74th Venice Film Festival in 2017.

        "text": "It takes a special kind of cynicism to assert that long-term planning must have primacy over short-term expediency while defending a policy choice that does the exact opposite. Rishi Sunak’s decision to postpone deadlines for the transition to low-carbon technology is the very definition of tactical partisanship trumping strategic statecraft. That the prime minister sought to present it otherwise in a televised address to the nation on Wednesday shows contempt for anyone who understands the urgency of the climate crisis.The prime minister veils his ploy in economic terms. The claim is that measures designed to accelerate the switch to low-carbon technology – a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030, for example, and a deadline for phasing out the installation of new gas boilers by 2035 – heap the cost of transition on consumers. Downing Street insists the commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 stands, but will be reached by “more proportionate” means.The electoral calculation is that voters can be spooked by the retail price of electric vehicles and low-carbon heating solutions. A campaign can then be fought on the basis that Labour represents eco-fanatics who want to force drivers off the roads, while Tories represent hardworking folk in ordinary cars. The belief that this can work is derived, in part, from the Uxbridge byelection in July, when the plans of London’s Labour mayor for new charges on heavily polluting vehicles were weaponised in a campaign that kept the seat in Conservative hands.There are also examples across Europe of radical rightwing parties mining a backlash against environmental regulation for electoral gain. In the US, hostility to low-carbon measures and outright denial of climate science, suffused with paranoid conspiracy theories, are embedded in the Republican mainstream. Those trends, amplified by funding and lobbying from fossil-fuel industries, have some purchase on British Conservatism but have not thus far dictated the direction of policy.Mr Sunak’s dilution of net zero goals is less extreme but still insidious. In his speech, the prime minister affected continuity with climate change consensus while digging trenches for a new culture war front.",

Wood and smokeless fuels are being sold in local DIY shops and garages, and once again my neighbourhood is filled with the smell of smoke.A fire may look cosy but it comes with a wider cost. Last year’s chief medical officer’s report recognised that solid fuels are by far the most polluting way to heat a home.A study, by Ricardo Energy and Environment, has estimated that 284 Londoners are now dying early each year due to outdoor air pollution from solid fuel heating. They also estimated about 90 new cases of asthma in children, 60 new cases of stroke and 30 new lung cancer cases each year.This creates annual health and economy cost of £187m, or £24 per Londoner, regardless of whether they burn solid fuels or not. Taking a polluter-should-pay perspective, this is an average burden of almost £800 a year created by each person in London who uses a fireplace or stove.The London study is broadly in line with a European-wide estimate of €760 (£650) yearly societal-health cost for each household that uses a wood stove.Prof Fay Johnston, from the Menzies Institute for Medical Research, Tasmania, who was not involved in the London research said: “Given the high health and economic burden of pollution from this type of heating, interventions to reduce wood heaters in densely populated areas will be highly cost effective. Even small reductions in outdoor wood smoke will reduce the community burden of chronic heart and lung diseases, and increase the average life expectancy of people living in London.”According to UK government figures, home use of solid fuels is the second largest source of airborne particle pollution in the UK. Although some burning takes place outside, such as patio heating in summer, solid fuel pollution is mainly measured during winter evenings when people are heating their homes.This problem is not confined to London nor to big cities.In Chorley, Lancashire Mark Tebbutt has worked with friends and neighbours to install measurement equipment across the town. Their data shows frequent breaches of World Health Organization guidelines and reveals the burning habits of the residents.",

Britain’s leading garden charity said that although the gastropods were the garden visitor about which they received most complaints, they should be considered an important part of the garden ecosystem.The RHS has been following the method in its own gardens and recently found the nationally scarce wood cricket by the river at Wisley in Surrey. The silver-washed fritillary butterfly, which is of conservation concern, has been discovered on specific plants at Rosemoor in Devon.Golding is inspired by the ecologist Jennifer Owen who for 30 years studied what she found in her urban garden in Leicester, mapping 2,673 different species of flora and fauna, including 474 plants, 80 types of spider and 445 moths.“Definitely take pictures of new and unexpected plants – sometimes known as weeds – in your garden,” Golding said. “Take a picture and send it in so we can identify it. Once it’s ID’d you can find out a bit more about it because now you know what it is, and you can get a bit of understanding of what it is. Is it important, is it something a bit rarer?

But it was not until six years later that he was able to capture the extraordinary image of a male Japanese giant salamander guarding hundreds of eggs, which gained him a place in the finals of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition, staged by London’s Natural History Museum. The salamander was named Fukuda-kun in his honour.It was the first time the nesting behaviour of these mysterious amphibians, which it is thought could live up to 100 years and whose biology has changed little over the last 23m years, had been caught on camera.But then, for four years, Fukuda-kun was nowhere to be seen. “He got stuck beneath a dam downstream,” says Fukuda, before the salamander eventually managed to make his way around the barrier.The second largest of the world’s three main giant salamander species (the others are in China and the US), Japanese giant salamanders (Andrias japonicus) can grow up to 1.5 metres in length. The heaviest specimen on record is in Tottori Prefectural Museum and weighs 44.3kg. Despite their size, these creatures face multiple threats, among them the weirs, dams and concrete riverbanks that fragment their habitat in the rivers of central and western Japan – the only places where this species lives in the wild.No one knows how many Japanese giant salamanders are left. Its red list status has been changed from ‘near threatened’ to ‘vulnerable’. Photograph: Yukihiro Fukuda/TopOutImagesThe artificial barriers, built for flood control and to improve irrigation for agriculture, prevent them from migrating upstream to reach breeding sites, as well as destroying the natural dens where the salamanders reproduce and hatch their eggs. In some areas it is likely that local populations are already extinct, says Yuki Taguchi, a researcher and member of the Japanese Giant Salamander Society.In December 2022, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) changed their red list status from “near threatened” to “vulnerable”.",

The study’s first author, Prof John Woinarski of Charles Darwin University, said this made getting adequate information for some of the species “quite tricky”.Some species, such as the Flinders Ranges worm-lizard, southern cassowary and gouldian finch, have benefited from habitat management, the researchers found.Populations of others have increased after intensive control of introduced predators, and by translocating animals to predator-free islands.The EPBC Act stipulates that species should not be delisted if doing so might have a negative impact on their survival. While the researchers believe successes should be celebrated, they warn that conservations gains could be lost if management efforts were to cease.",

When energy prices are higher than an undisclosed maximum, the spoils will be shared between the energy companies and the NSW government.Record renewables help bring down Australia’s energy prices and emissionsRead moreThere were winning bids of less than $35 a megawatt hour for two solar farms and less than $50 a megawatt hour for a windfarm, the auction organiser, Aemo Services, said. These prices are perhaps the lowest for such auctions ever seen in Australia.“The transition to clean renewable energy in NSW is essential and under way,” said the NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe.“This tender has shown how much demand there is to invest in NSW to build renewable energy and it is very welcome that this investment will also support 3,300 jobs over the next 10 years.”The first tender locks in 1.4 gigawatts of new clean energy generation, bringing the total committed so far to 4.1 gigawatts as part of the former Coalition government’s 12 gigawatt target by 2030.

Dozens more were missing.According to reports, almost a million people have been evacuated in the region. Rescue and recovery crews searched flooded streets in rubber dinghies for any trapped behind. Hundreds of flights were either delayed or cancelled at the city’s two major airports.China has been hit hard by extreme weather in recent months, from record-breaking heatwaves to deadly rain. In July, employers across the country were ordered to limit outdoor work due to blistering heat. On Wednesday, the Beijing meteorological service said 744.8mm of rain had fallen since the previous Saturday, shattering a previous record of 609mm, set in 1891.That is as much as Beijing usually gets in the whole of July. In neighbouring Hebei province, things were even worse. From Saturday to Monday, one local weather station recorded 1,003mm of rain, almost twice the annual average.According to Chinese meteorologists, the rains were brought by the aftermath of Storm Doksuri, a former super typhoon, as it swept northwards over China after hitting Fujian province, in the south, last week.As the residual circulation of Doksuri’s rain clouds blew north, a subtropical and continental high pressure system in the atmosphere also blocked their north and eastward passage, leading to a convergence of water vapour that acted like a dam storing the water.Then, as the clouds above northern China grew pregnant with millions of tonnes of water, they were lifted up by a low-altitude wind, pushing the rain east of the Taihang mountains, to where the worst-hit areas – including Beijing’s Fangshan and Mentougou districts – are located.Passengers walk past cars submerged in flood water in the Mentougou district of Beijing on Monday.

Germany missed its targets on cutting consumption of gas under the cold conditions, the German grid agency said.But only a small proportion of last month’s drop in fossil fuel use should be attributed to the weather, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air analysis. The mild temperatures contributed a 6% reduction in gas demand outside the power sector – mostly for heating – while actual demand fell 26%. Within the power sector, milder temperatures can account for two percentage points of the 12% drop in demand, the analysts found.Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst and author of the report, said the data showed that accusations against the EU of falling back on climate commitments were wrong. “There has been a very widespread perception that Europe is going backwards on climate change, because of the Ukraine war,” he said. “There were frequent remarks to that effect at Cop27, saying Europe was going back to coal. We are showing that has not been the case – there was a misreading of coal consumption.”Some member states, including Germany and Poland, have sought a limited return to burning coal for power generation in the face of soaring gas prices and supply constraints in after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK has also put coal-fired power plants on standby.In November, the EU as a whole used less coal than in the same month last year, and than in the same month for the past three decades. Germany and Poland both used less coal than a year ago, though Finland slightly increased its coal use.There were dramatic reductions in output from nuclear reactors in Germany and France.",

Interviewed before the book’s launch, Rebanks is scathing about how Brexit and its aftermath have destroyed farmers’ livelihoods, and in some cases their lives.“Farming is going through a huge challenge with the government post-Brexit,” she says. “Since the 1950s farmers have been encouraged to produce, produce, produce and have been supported. But then came the catastrophe of foot and mouth disease and there was rebuilding for some: others went out of business. Farmers have relied on EU subsidies which, however imperfect, were at least a system – basic payment for the land you farmed. But that has been incrementally reduced year on year, so farmers’ income keeps coming further down.”She is particularly critical of the government’s trade agreements with non-EU countries that were supposed to create a new “global Britain” in which farmers and everyone else running businesses would thrive after Brexit.Instead they find imports are now undercutting homegrown produce. “The most recent is Mexico for eggs – from battery hens,” says Rebanks. “Our egg producers are going out of business because feed costs, heating, lighting, energy costs – everything to do with production – has gone up. There are fewer British eggs because supermarkets won’t pay the true cost of production. How are farmers supposed to make a living?",

Photograph: Maureen McLean/Rex/ShutterstockJosh Babarinde, a Lib Dem councillor in Eastbourne who is also the candidate for the Conservative-held parliamentary seat, a key target for the party, says sewage is raised spontaneously as often as the NHS during local door knocking. “It is one of the most common issues that comes up on the doorstep. Beaches are the lifeblood of this town.”Speaking after the next leg in his day of campaigning, a tour around the vast and hi-tech warehouse of a locally based book wholesaler, Davey says sewage has even supplanted that perennial issue in local elections, the pothole.“It’s much bigger than potholes,” he said. “Potholes are a very serious issue, and they do move votes, but for sewage, the reason why it’s so dramatic is it brings the pollution of our natural environment and the damage that it’s doing to our rivers and our seas, and wildlife and plants and animals, to human health.”The rise of sewage as an electoral issue is notable for several reasons, one of which is how the Lib Dems chipped away at it for so long without notable interest from other parties.",

A group of young people are working on one of the many vegetable and fruit terraces, their laughter mixing with the sound of water in the riverbed below. I tell myself that one day I will be back. But for now, it is goodbye. I’m leaving the eco-village in southern Spain, this cluster of old, whitewashed houses set in a green valley where I’ve spent the past six years.My partner and I first arrived in Los Molinos – in Almería province, the driest part of Spain – in 2006, after a long spell in north London. Our experience of eco-living was limited to regular recycling and buying biodegradable laundry and bathroom products. In Spain, we had to learn how to live completely off-grid. All our electricity came from the array of solar panels in the garden, which meant we couldn’t have energy-hungry devices such as toasters and electric kettles. We even had to forgo the internet because there was no connection.The solar panels in the gardenThe water that supplied our house was drawn from a stream by means of a solar-powered electric pump. We had to navigate the outside compost loo, making sure that we directed our urine into a trough, away from the chamber for solid waste; the combination of the two would produce an almighty stink. We learned Spanish, harvested olives, grapes and pomegranates, and grew a whole variety of vegetables. And in many ways it was paradise. The sun shone most of the year. The other villagers had fascinating life experiences and there was a great sense of community. I made friends with a wide range of people from around the world, the kind of people I would never have met in my north London bubble.And yet after six years, we knew it was time to leave. Our parents, back in the UK, were getting older and would need support.",

Earlier this week, the National Drought Group said England was “one dry spell away” from a repeat of last summer’s dry conditions.Batters said farmers were watching anxiously. “We’ve still got East Anglia, Devon and Cornwall that are in drought,” she said. “We’ve got 63% of rivers below the level that they should be.”“If we’re going to abstract less, we’ve got to store more,” she said, which would mean constructing more reservoirs. “We’ve got to have the ability to store more, that needs to be thought about very urgently. This is a massive issue.”Acute shortages of salad and vegetables in the UK have led to empty shelves, and driven some supermarkets to ration the sale of items such as peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes. Those problems have been mainly caused by unseasonably cold weather and frosts in key exporting regions of Spain and north Africa.The empty shelves have focused attention on the UK’s food security. About 40% of the country’s food is imported, and farmers at the NFU conference in Birmingham earlier this week said this left the UK vulnerable to outside supply shocks.For Batters, food security and the question of water are closely intertwined. There can be none of the former unless the government takes action to secure supplies of the latter, she said.“Water is a massive issue. I’ve had the line trotted out to me so many times: ‘Oh Minette, we are a wealthy nation, we can import our food.’ I just think that ship has sailed, and we take food for granted … And water security is a massive part of that.",

A crumbling petrol station, a pair of abandoned cars, a caravan that could once have been towed on myriad, jolly holidays and is now abandoned on a hilltop.A collection of beautiful photographs taken by the Welsh landscape photographer David Wilson drawn together in a book called Peeling Paint and Rust is a hymn to decay, and a respectful nod to the power of his country’s rain and damp.Wilson, who is based in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, is known for his black and white landscape photographs, but for two decades has also been taking colour pictures of structures that are – just about – withstanding the elements.“On my travels, I kept encountering the incredible colours and textures of peeling paint and rust,” said Wilson. “I’d be on my way to a location and suddenly I’d see a bright, flaking village shopfront – or a corrugated garage or tractor graveyard and be stopped in my tracks. The colours were amazing and I had to capture them.“Over nearly 20 years I accumulated a collection of images of this wonderful decay and one day I realised that they hung together as a whole. Together, they tell a story of rural Wales. The patina of weather-aged surfaces and rusting metal feel like works of art to me.”Wilson said Wales wasn’t kind to bodywork and neglected buildings. “Wales has proper weather. Brutal on occasion. The kind of weather that degrades our best efforts at preservation. Paint peels and metal rusts in outdoor Wales.”His studies of corrugated iron are particularly striking. “We’ve taken it as our own. It’s been used extensively from the 19th century for sheds, garages, houses, chapels, all manner of structures, big and small. We Welsh love this crinkly material.”But Wilson acknowledged the sadness in the pictures. “I felt I was documenting a dislocation in the rural communities of Wales. A dying way of life. The world moves on and it seemed to have left these places and their objects behind.”He said it was becoming difficult to find studies in decay. “People are inclined to tidy things up. Put things right. That obsession with neatness and order.",

Seagrass is one of the largest carbon sinks we have globally, despite covering only 0.1% of the ocean floor.“It also serves as a shelter, feeding ground and nursery for a host of marine life, including vulnerable species such as seahorses, and the young of commercial fish and seafood stocks. Seagrass beds play an important role in helping to combat erosion of the coastline from the waves, as storms increase in their intensity due to climate change.”Seagrass meadows, which can flower and photosynthesise in shallow seas, are important because they stabilise the sediments in which they grow and provide food and shelter for other species thereby enhancing biodiversity.They also sequester and store carbon in their leaves, branches and root systems, as well as in the sediment below and around them. When seagrass meadows are stable and healthy, they can be highly effective carbon sinks.Among the marine animals seen by divers in the seagrass were the short-snouted seahorse, broadnosed pipefish, little cuttlefish and scallops.The volunteer divers also examined beds of maerl, delicate coral-like algae, a little further out from the coast, where they found an additional 66 species including the curled octopus and streaked gurnard.Some areas within the beds were free of litter and other human impact, though rubbish – and a large number of golf balls hit errantly from a seaside course – and some old fishing gear were found in other places.",

The Maasai regard this land as their home.The leaders arrested last week have not been seen since they were detained.

The report blamed a lack of public charging infrastructure in the UK, and warned that the government’s decision to delay a ban on the sale of new combustion engine vehicles could shake investor confidence.The prime minister announced plans to push back the ban on new fossil fuel vehicles from 2030 until 2035 as part of a significant watering down of the government’s key climate policies designed to help Britain become net zero by 2050.The unexpected U-turn has led to confusion among carmakers and electric vehicle infrastructure investors by raising uncertainty over how soon British drivers will make the switch to electric options. This could further delay expansion of charging networks, according to the report.The analysis found the UK now has 11.3 electric vehicles for every publicly accessible charge point, leading to “range anxiety” for drivers considering buying an electric vehicle for longer journeys.In the Netherlands there is 2.8 electric vehicles for each public charge point, while Sweden and Germany have 8.4 and 12.8 respectively, according to the data for Shoosmiths’ electric vehicle country attractiveness (EVCA) index.Jamie Maule, a research analyst at Cornwall Insight, said the challenges to the UK’s electric vehicle rollout risked being compounded by Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on sales of new combustion engine vehicles.The prime minister also signalled a slowdown in the phasing out of gas boilers and promised to scrap a requirement for landlords to make their properties energy efficient.“This threatens to erode the country’s momentum in shifting away from traditional fossil fuel cars,” Maule said.",

The Greens’ continuing concern may increase the likelihood of a deal between the Labor government and Coalition opposition to pass the reforms, called for by the gas industry itself.“Big gas corporations are already robbing us blind, making billions of dollars of windfall profits and paying next to no tax, and now Labor’s writing sweetheart deals for Woodside,” the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, claimed.“Labor’s changes to the gas tax benefit the gas corporations, not the public.”Woodside withstands investor backlash against climate policies at tense meetingRead moreThe Treasury department’s review of the PRRT, presented to the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, this month, recommends the government limit deductible expenditure to 90% of PRRT assessable receipts for each project in each year, with unused deductions to be carried forward and uplifted at the government long-term bond rate.But the report recommends this cap not apply to certain classes of deductible expenditure in the PRRT: closing-down expenditure, starting base expenditure and resource tax expenditure.The Australian Taxation Office’s website states “starting base expenditure is only relevant to the North West Shelf project”; as well as that “resource tax expenditure only applies to the North West Shelf project”.

The Science-Based Targets Network (SBTN) is providing the first framework for companies to report their impacts on nature as part a new frontier of corporate environmental reporting.SBTN is releasing guidance for companies measuring how they contribute to land degradation, and the use and pollution of freshwater. Companies can then work out what impacts they should focus on reducing and what targets they can set to achieve that. Reporting systems for oceans and species abundance are still being worked on and are to be released in the coming year.Already, more than 2,600 companies report on their carbon emissions using science-based targets, and the new framework is part of a move to make business take account of nature in the same way. Erin Billman, executive director of SBTN, said: “We are in the midst of interconnected crises. We cannot limit global warming to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels] without addressing nature loss, and we cannot halt and reverse nature loss without a stable climate.”The UN says businesses should assess and disclose their impacts on nature by 2030, and the idea of the SBTN is to ensure that there is consensus on how companies do that. Billman said: “It’s moving nature into the boardroom … there is enough information for companies to be able to assess and prioritise where to take action.”As part of the pilot release, 17 companies, including H&M, Kering, Nestlé and Tesco, will submit data on their impacts on nature by the end of the year. Those targets will be validated as in line with science-based targets from early 2024. Other companies can also submit data starting now, with validation starting next year.SBTN will validate targets if they align with the overarching UN aim of halting and reversing nature loss by 2030.",

In branches of McDonald’s across north, east and south India, signs were put up to state that tomatoes would no longer be put in burgers and other dishes, due to a lack of availability.A spokesperson for a McDonald’s operator in north India confirmed they had removed tomatoes temporarily from food in some branches, due to “seasonal crop issues arising out of farm fields in a few regions” which meant there were “not enough quantities meeting our quality specifications”.“We should be able to bring tomatoes back to the menu soon,” they added.The human-caused climate emergency is making extreme rainfall more common and more intense, while heatwaves are increasingly likely to happen.Several small-scale tomato farmers said this had been one of their most devastating seasons in terms of production and profit.Arvind Malik, 34, a tomato farmer from Kheri Dabdalan village in the Kurukshetra district of Haryana, described how disease began to strike this season’s crop.“In February, the leaves of tomato plants started drying up,” he said.",

That narrowest of victories may have been the single most important environmental development of 2022. With Mr Bolsonaro in power, the Amazon rainforest was hurtling towards a tipping point after which it would no longer function as a climate stabiliser and the world’s biggest carbon sink. Between August 2021 and July 2022, an area of forest the size of Qatar was cleared in the interests of big business.Lula’s government has stopped the rot. Companies involved in illegal deforestation have been sanctioned, armed interventions have taken place to end illegal mining operations, and new conservation areas have been established. Deforestation dropped by 42% during Lula’s first seven months in office, and the state has returned as a protective presence in the Brazilian Amazon. The transformed political context was the catalyst for this week’s landmark regional summit in Belém, in which the eight Latin American nations sharing the Amazon came together – for the first time in 14 years – to produce a plan for its sustainable development.The outcome was only a partial success. Tuesday’s Belém declaration outlines important new areas of cooperation in combating illegal logging, mining and burning in the Amazon. But it failed to formalise a target of ending deforestation by 2030 – a commitment already adopted by Lula’s Brazil, and one credited with driving much of the progress his government has made this year. Leaders were also unable to agree a common position on the future of industries such as cattle farming, mining and oil, which are driving the destruction. This was, then, a weaker document than environmental groups, and Lula himself, had hoped for. But as it rightly argues, game-changing progress in these areas will not be achieved without assistance – on a transformative scale – from the richer nations that have benefited from exploitation of the Amazon’s resources. If less well-off countries facing huge financial challenges are to rethink the Amazon’s economy, and protect its biodiversity, such stewardship in the global interest will need to be properly rewarded.",

But under the draft legislation, subsidence, one of the most contentious impacts of CSG extraction, will be removed from that assessment process and instead assessed under the MERCP Act.“They’re stripping the ability for farmers to protect their land,” Pointon said.In its own submission to the state government, the peak farming body Agforce Queensland said it was supportive of the proposed introduction of a new subsidence impact framework but “strongly disagrees” with the removal of CSG-induced subsidence impacts from the RPI Act.Liza Balmain runs a cotton and mixed grain farm 200km west of Brisbane and has been a staunch opponent to CSG expansion in the area for almost a decade, hosting the independent senator David Pocock, environmental and legal experts, and farmers at a meeting in opposition to Arrow Energy’s Surat gas project this year.

Of course she needed long sleeves and closed shoes. The teacher explained that long sleeves provided better protection. If there were any cuts or nicks, a bit of coverage could make a difference.I never made that mistake again. There was a lot to learn at bush kinder, a kindergarten program held in the parklands of inner Melbourne. The theory behind it was great: nature play improves children’s wellbeing, social and emotional development, cognitive language and physical skills – a string of nice words that I definitely wanted for my daughter. But really I was mainly glad she was outside. No screens. No toys. No equipment. Just what she needed after two years of lockdowns.Three-year-old bush kinder was three hours every week. She went, armed with snacks, gumboots and rain pants. She wore a sticker with a phone number on her back in case she wandered off. (I was told this was a precaution and not something that was likely to happen.) She learned to use a camping toilet even though there was a toilet block with actual plumbing. And she went there rain, hail or shine, recording a new personal best for putting on a rain jacket (hood first, arms in, zip up) in every session.When the fundamentals were mastered, her group did trail walks, exploring the creek, looking at different animals, insects and plants, and observing how they change over the seasons.It was a big step-up the following year. Four-year-old bush kinder was seven and a half hours a week. Every session was an adventure. Angus got a bloody nose and Oscar was stung by a bee. Once Ranger Pete came to talk about fire safety. They built a campfire, learning to read the direction of the smoke before each child placed a stick on the fire.Do yourself and other parents a favour – lower the bar | Emma WilkinsRead moreHer time outdoors has sparked a kind of curiosity, confidence and resilience that I had not expected.",

It was one of the most ambitious targets set by any country in the battle to halt the worst effects of climate change. This is a nation committed to limiting global temperature rises, claimed Conservative party leaders.Sadly those proud battle cries and that Churchillian rhetoric have not been matched by action. For the past four years, government departments have failed to put in place any coherent policies that could help limit carbon emissions.Revealed: cabinet ministers warned of legal action over UK’s failure to tackle climate crisisRead moreThis neglect had already become abundantly clear last summer when the high court ruled – ironically, on one of the hottest days on record in Britain – that the government’s strategies had failed to meet its obligations to produce a detailed plan for achieving its carbon cut commitments. Little appears to have changed since then.Delivery on net zero was always going to need strong action by all government departments. None passed muster, with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) emerging as one of the worst laggards, with its secretary of state, Thérèse Coffey, giving the clear impression she simply does not take climate policy seriously.Across government, words have not been followed by action. Consider the issue of heat pumps. Up to 600,000 per year would be installed by 2028, the nation was promised. In this way, we would phase out gas-burning, carbon-emitting central heating systems from millions of households. However, a House of Lords committee revealed last month that there was now no chance of meeting that target. A mere 50,000 heat pumps were installed last year – and this was at a time when the phasing out of gas central heating would have helped cut sky-high energy bills and increase the UK’s energy security.The consequences of this failure to act will be harmful not just to our climate control efforts but to our international reputation as leaders in the battle against global heating, said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change.",

It was Caroline Lucas, the best prime minister we never had – and, now that she is standing down from her Brighton Pavilion seat, we will never get.In her bold but gentle way, Lucas embodied the fact that politicians and politics could be better. Not perfect, but good enough. Good enough to know that meaningful change needs a vision of a good society to compel it, alongside bold enough policies and strong enough alliances to get us there.As the lone Green MP, Lucas embodied those traits and more. Necessity is the mother of invention. She had no choice but to forge alliances with other MPs, to work cooperatively on bills and campaigns on everything from stopping fracking to reversing the ludicrous privatisation of our water companies.Tony Benn famously said that politics wasn’t about personalities but issues. He was both right and wrong. Politics is about ideas, movement and moments. But it is always about people – about political leaders. We need charismatic, inspiring and purposeful leadership. Not demagogues, but full-time professionals who know their job is to help us build a good society and lead good lives.The energy and ambition Lucas brought to this pursuit was incredible. Great works are performed, as Samuel Johnson told us, not by strength but by perseverance. Lucas persevered. But she is human. And political humans, as we saw with Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s former prime minister, tire and burn out. The system is so broken that no single person can hope to fix it.Lucas has signalled that she will continue to work tirelessly on climate change, again echoing Benn, who said on leaving Westminster that he was stepping down to spend more time with his politics.But Westminster, Whitehall and formal politics do matter. They are the sites that set the rules that determine how we regulate society, the economy and our democracy, and how we invest public money.",

She has worked with experts to prepare the land for the beavers and build an enclosure for them to meet current licensing rules. She has also spoken to local farmers and residents about the beavers and the changes they could bring to the landscape.Welcome to wild Britain: the beavers are back and there’s more to comeRead moreBeavers were hunted to extinction in Britain 400 years ago for their fur, glands and meat. They have begun to reappear after the government licensed beaver releases within enclosures, as well as illegal releases taking place around the country. Some experts suggests there are hundreds of beavers living wild along England’s waterways.In 2022, beavers were given legal protection in England, making it illegal to kill or harm them as they are formally recognised as native wildlife. Environmentalists hope the upcoming beaver strategy will pave the way for this beloved rodent to be released to roam wild.Beavers are known as a “keystone species”, because they create new wetlands that are used by other species, including dozens of bird and insect species.A growing body of evidence from reintroduction sites also shows that beaver dams slow the passage of water through landscapes, cutting flood risk downstream and also conserving water in times of drought.Lieu said she was thrilled to bring back beavers to Hampshire after 400 years.",

By last weekend, the city’s air quality index (AQI) had reached levels considered extremely hazardous to health.To try to reduce them, on Saturday the Punjab government used cloud seeding to create rain in 10 locations around the city using a small Cessna plane.To create the clouds, there needs to be enough moisture already present in the clouds in the lower atmosphere. In summer, common table salt mixed with water is sprayed over the cloud patches from planes. After a few hours, the mist integrates with the clouds and produces rain. In winter, the clouds are seeded using flakes of silver iodide, which can be fired from a vehicle or a plane.The practice, also known as “blueskying”, has been used to induce precipitation in several countries in the Middle East, as well as China and India.Bilal Afzal, the provincial caretaker minister for the environment, said the cloud seeding had been a success, but admitted rainfall was “scanty” as the cloud quality was not very good. Nevertheless, Lahore’s air quality improved with just a few millimetres of rain, dropping from an AQI of more than 300 to 189, Afzal said. However, the benefits lasted only a couple of days before pollution returned to its previous level.The exercise did not cause any significant disruption. “I just got a spatter on my car while driving home from the clinic around 3pm and thought it was bird droppings,” said Zaeema Naeem, a doctor in Lahore.Afzal said the authorities planned to carry out cloud seeding regularly during the smog season.",

The prime minister has also backed “maxing out” oil and gas reserves.Speaking during the G20 summit of world leaders in India, Sunak again hinted that he wanted to limit the impact of net zero policies on consumers. “Net zero done in the right way can be very beneficial for jobs,” he said. “That’s what we’ve got to make sure that the story is about. The net zero story for me shouldn’t be a hair shirt story of giving everything up and your bills going up. That’s not the vision of net zero that I think is the right one for the UK.”The Tory party’s position on policies designed to help it achieve its goal of reaching net zero by 2050 has become increasingly fraught.The right of the party has become emboldened by the Conservatives’ success at the Uxbridge byelection, where a focus on the unpopularity of London’s ultra-low emission zone led to various demands to row back on green commitments that would hit voters.However, there is now a growing response from the liberal wing, which believes that abandoning the party’s green credentials spells disaster and will further alienate younger voters who are already being put off by the Conservatives. At a gathering of the liberal Tory Reform Group this weekend, senior figures urged Sunak to stick to his net zero pledges.Damian Green, the former de facto deputy prime minister who chairs the One Nation group of Tory MPs, warned: “The voices wanting us to renege on our commitment to net zero by 2050 are wrong both in policy and political terms.” He added: “We promised this in the 2019 manifesto and we should try to stick to our promises.",

But the large blue (Phengaris arion) – the species that has been worst affected across Europe, where numbers are down 82% since 1990– is actually thriving in Britain due to a reintroduction programme and ongoing targeted conservation management.Other species showing significant declines across Europe include the wall (Lasiommata megera), down 68%, the adonis blue (Lysandra bellargus), falling by 64%, and the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), down 61%.Conservation scientists attribute the ongoing declines to agricultural intensification. This includes the ploughing of traditional grasslands and the heavy use of fertilisers and herbicides, which destroy the wildflowers and grasses that butterfly caterpillars feed on.Nitrogen deposition from vehicle emissions and agriculture is also a factor, alongside global heating.Nigel Bourn, chief scientist at Butterfly Conservation, said: “These really horrific large-scale declines are driven by major changes across Europe, although it’s very difficult to tease apart the relative contribution of all these major changes we’re seeing.“It’s pretty depressing. These are widespread species and we should be really worried about them and what they tell us about the state of the general countryside.

There was also strong evidence they reduced road casualties.One frequent criticism of LTNs is that they simply push car use to the periphery, to busier main roads.

This was London’s worst air pollution since January 2017.These short episodes of air pollution have an impact. A five-year study of 1.2 million Londoners published in 2021 found a rise in GP respiratory consultations and inhaler prescriptions after short increases in air pollution. This was more pronounced in children and persisted for at least a week.Home wood burning played a large role in the pollution peaks last weekend, according to data from Imperial College London on the chemical composition of the particle pollution in London, especially during the evenings. Analysis of the soot particles that Londoners were breathing showed that between 60% and 70% came from wood or solid fuel heating. Averaged over the whole year, home fires in the UK produce more particle pollution than the exhaust of all traffic on our roads.And yet enforcement and control remains ineffective. Dr James Heydon, of the University of Nottingham, has been researching the way in which the legal controls on home fires have failed to address this problem. These laws include smoke control areas (SCAs) or smokeless zones that were devised in the 1950s and cover most UK cities. In these areas, people who burn solid fuel have to use a certified appliance or burn smokeless fuel. In an SCA, burning wood on an open fire is illegal.Heydon’s research included freedom of information requests to local councils and interviews with council staff. A sample of 30 councils revealed 2,524 complaints about chimney smoke between 2014 and 2020. Despite this volume of complaints, only two councils had taken court action, a total of four cases over six years.Heydon said: “There are myriad of practical difficulties, including responding to complaints out of hours, being able to see ‘smoke’ at night, and gathering enough evidence to determine its origin from an ‘uncertified’ source. These problems are compounded by recent efforts at making enforcement easier.",

No overseas offsets would be bought.Australian councils told to cut emissions rather than spend millions on overseas carbon offsetsRead moreKean said buying $80 of credits was the equivalent to offsetting 2.4 tonnes of CO2 – the average annual emissions of a light vehicle in the state.The transport sector was responsible for 22% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions, with half of that coming from passenger vehicles, Kean said.But critics have lambasted the scheme for potentially deterring people from reducing their emissions.

Offsets don’t really reduce emissions, and they don’t compensate for an emission of carbon dioxide coming out of the tailpipe of a car.”He said the NSW government should focus on a more rapid rollout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure rather than promoting “gimmicks such as offering to offset drivers emissions per year for $80”.",

For every €1 governments spent building railways, they spent €1.6 building roads.“This is a political choice,” said Lorelei Limousin, a climate campaigner with Greenpeace, which commissioned the report. “We see the consequences today with the climate, but also with people who have been left without an alternative solution to cars.”The report found the EU, Norway, Switzerland and the UK spent €1.5tn (£1.29tn) between 1995 and 2018 to extend their roads – but just €0.93tn (£0.8tn) to extend their rail networks.In the four years that followed (2018-21), the average gap in investment in rail and road decreased from 66% to 34%. During that time, seven countries invested more in rail than roads – Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the UK – while the rest spent more on roads than rail.Dr Giulio Mattioli, a transport researcher at the Technical University of Dortmund, who was not involved in the study, said: “Most European countries have been actually encouraging car use by investing large amounts of public money into expanding motorway infrastructure.”In the public and political debate, Mattioli added, small investments into bike lanes and railways were heavily scrutinised while investments in roads were taken for granted. “This absolutely needs to change if we are to meet climate mitigation targets in the transport sector.”The report found motorways grew most in Ireland, Romania and Poland, and least in Lithuania, Latvia and Belgium. In 15 of the 30 countries studied, the lengths of motorways more than doubled over the 25-year period.European governments have closed about 8,523 miles of regional passenger railway lines since the mid-90s, the study claims.

You may say it is all in the antlers: I say it is all in the tail. I saw a small herd of fallow deer in London’s Clissold park recently.

Unlike the freezing bomb cyclone endured by the US at Christmas, or the floods that swept through the Philippines, they are unlikely to cause immediate widespread death and devastation. At a time when soaring energy costs have pushed so many into poverty, many will have welcomed the warmth that has been felt across Europe, especially the millions in Ukraine suffering due to Russia’s attacks on its power infrastructure.Yet the heatwave should alarm us all. Though it may have been less punitive to experience than last summer’s record temperatures, which led to thousands of deaths, it has spread across many more countries. “We can regard this as the most extreme event in European history,” said one climatologist. Poland, where the average January temperature is around 1C, saw the thermometer climb to 19C on New Year’s Day. At least seven more European countries have seen record highs. Ski resorts closed slopes or resorted to artificial snow. Though the weather might seem mild, it is disrupting crops and wildlife, and of course sudden thaws can lead to avalanches or floods.Natural variations in weather demand caution when attributing individual events. But the pattern is unmistakable: rising temperatures and extreme weather events intensified by human-made global heating. On Thursday, the Met Office confirmed that 2022 was Britain’s hottest year on record, with the annual average temperature passing 10C for the first time – and the heat made 160 times more likely by the climate crisis. Nasa says that the last decade saw eight of the 10 warmest years since modern records began in the 1880s. A shift that was previously clear in data is now viscerally confronting people who may previously have been largely indifferent to the risks. Lines on a graph are easier to ignore than trees flowering in the wrong season, flash floods and unbearable heat or cold.Ten years ago, it would have seemed outlandish to talk of the kind of temperatures and extreme weather now witnessed regularly. Frighteningly, all this is happening with a rise of just 1.1C above pre-industrial temperatures. Yet 2022 set other records too: renewables are performing far beyond predictions.",

Thanks to nest cameras, viewers can watch the female osprey incubate her egg on a livestream.Live webcam of a Poole Harbour Osprey nest platform.The birds of prey were once common across western Europe, but due to persecution by humans as well as habitat loss, they became locally extinct in the early 1800s. Their nests were historically plundered for their eggs, and the birds were shot for taxidermy. Today, they are still regularly shot for sport in southern Europe.Since 2017, experts at the Roy Dennis Foundation and Birds of Poole Harbour have been working to reintroduce them to southern England, by relocating adult birds from Scotland. There is a breeding population at Rutland Water in the Midlands, after a translocation programme that began in 1996, and after decades of conservation efforts there are now hundreds of ospreys in Scotland.Paul Morton from Birds of Poole Harbour said: “To know there’s now an osprey egg in a Poole Harbour nest is just amazing. This is the culmination of seven years’ hard work. Projects like this are always going to take time, but it’s such a great feeling to know that the birds have reached this important milestone, and to see CJ7 incubating her first egg is stunning.“There’s still a lot for them both to learn as new parents, and breeding success is certainly not guaranteed. However, everything we’re seeing at the moment is looking really positive, and hopefully by late May we’ll begin to see them feeding their newly hatched fledglings.”It is hoped that the pair will produce two more eggs over the next week, and then a 35-40 day incubation period beginswith the possibility of osprey chicks hatching by late May.",

This is a disgrace. Water companies shouldn’t be allowed to get away with pumping thousands of hours of filthy sewage into our rivers and waterways. We need the Conservatives to stop sitting on their hands, tax water companies and end this scandal.”Megan Corton Scott, a political campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “We are the only country in the world to fully privatise our national water supply. This gave monopoly powers to the water companies with no conspicuous accountability and little commercial incentive to do anything but collect bill payments. People have no choice but to give them their money in exchange for performance that is, frankly, well below bog standard.“The theory that the innate decency of the companies’ management would ensure an acceptable level of service has been completely disproven. The results are in and allowing water companies to mark their own homework doesn’t work.

They will learn from this, and from Tree’s article, what a wild gardener really is.We concentrate on improving habitats for wildlife, so we nurture everything from piles of leaves to swift boxes, ponds to hedges, climbing plants to dry walls. We may leave fruit on our bushes, stands of nettle by our ponds, ivy on our shrubs and trees. We will be as busy as conventional gardeners in autumn, cutting back, taking cuttings, clearing paths. But we will pile up our leaves, or use them as mulch.Our plants will go to seed and fruit. Seeds and fruits from our plants will be available all year round for birds and insects, not just nectar in summer. We tend to use hand tools, not strimmers or leaf blowers. We tend to make compost, and don’t use peat or pesticides. Our gardens are beautiful and well-maintained. We often get involved with other land managers, such as churches and farmers, to try to promote wild spaces and reduce pesticides.Our village now has an annual prize for the best wild garden, and we have noted an increase in the sightings of hedgehogs, slowworms, frogs, toads and bats. Wild gardeners are a tolerant lot. It is a distressing sign of the times that the multimillion gardening industry feels the need for its attack dogs to savage us.Carol KuhlmannSt Dogmaels Wild Gardeners Group Isabella Tree’s article makes valid points about what rewilding is, not least the importance of using exotic plants, recognising that our arguably impoverished native flora and plant succession without intervention leads to reduced biodiversity.

This loss of predictability causes chaos for the behaviours of animals in particular, but can also impact trees and plants.”The National Trust gave a long list of species that have suffered in the last 12 months, including oak trees, which are increasingly vulnerable to the oak processionary moth, whose caterpillars infest them. The lack of prolonged cold snaps in recent years means the moths have spread northwards from their traditional home in the Mediterranean.Another troublemaker doing well is the heather beetle, which is killing off swathes of the heathland plant in some areas. A drone survey of Dunwich Heath in Suffolk revealed a 60% loss in heather.The warmer winters means hibernators such as dormice are emerging from their torpor too early and using up vital energy stores. It is also leading to red deer rutting later, meaning calves are born in the summer rather than the spring, with insufficient time to grow and put on fat reserves to survive.According to the trust, some of the rare lichens and liverworts that grow in the temperate rainforest at Lydford Gorge, on the edge of Dartmoor in Devon perished because of the lack of water last winter.But then water voles were driven from flooded burrows when the torrential rains have come in, putting them at increased risk of cold, hunger and predation.",

But you’d be advised to buckle up, too, for Eve Leigh’s turbulent hijacking drama, which nosedives into collective responsibility for the climate emergency.A steady flow of theatregoers becoming one audience and a gaggle of characters assembling a cast: Leigh is interested in how individual lives are subsumed into group behaviour and how the actions of one country can affect another. This is a playwright, too, who is refreshingly interested in bodies as well as words and Laura Keefe’s highly physical production, with movement direction by Carl Harrison, uses a choreography of collectivity. The flight attendant’s safety demonstration builds into a larky chorus line, there is a flash mob of headbanging to Rage Against the Machine and terror grips the passengers, so that they contort as one panicked mass.Fiddling while Puglia burns … Siubhan Harrison, Zoë West and Raj Bajaj in Wildfire Road. Photograph: Helen MurrayZoë Hurwitz’s set – one of those designs which keeps giving throughout the play – has a thrust, runway-like stage and gives the outline of the plane in strip lights, with actors spinning around on airline seats. The passenger list includes a couple on a bizarre first date, played by Phoebe Naughton and Mark Weinman, neatly evoking how jetting off lets us adopt slightly different identities. (There is also a subtle exploration throughout of different types of masks.)Leigh conveys the sheer weirdness of plane travel: the anonymous states epitomised by muzak and, mostly, how nodding off and bracing for catastrophe go cheek-by-jowl. That powerfully leads to the notion that, in terms of the climate crisis, we are fiddling while Rome burns – or, as the play has it, while Puglia is destroyed by wildfire.",

I was part of a group of scientists prosecuted for a protest action last year; our days in court, coupled with what we have learned about the experiences of many others, have left me with uncomfortable questions.Many people who have seen the inside of a court building will testify to the inefficiencies and inequalities that play out there. So when courts are as stretched as they seem to be, with a backlog of hundreds of thousands of trials, is it really in the public interest to prosecute peaceful protesters at all? Is it ever justifiable for non-violent defendants to be held in prison – some for many months – before their cases even make it to court? What is the cost of all of this, from the public money being spent on trials and imprisonment to the huge toll that incarceration and prosecution take on alleged criminals?Can we imagine an alternative where the resources being used to suppress protest movements were instead leveraged against a very different brand of offender: those in a powerful minority who exploit and deceive to profit from exacerbating the very crises that activists are being restricted from even mentioning in their defence?Dr Abi Perrin York Six weeks ago, aged 59, I became a convicted criminal.

Japanese winery tries to shake off negative imageRead moreTsunami waves crashed into Fukushima Daiichi, knocking out its backup electricity supply, triggering meltdowns in three of its reactors and sending large quantities of radiation into the atmosphere in the most serious nuclear accident since Chornobyl a quarter of a century earlier.The wastewater in Fukushima is being stored in more than 1,000 tanks that officials say need to be removed so the plant can be decommissioned – a process expected to take 30 to 40 years.Japan’s foreign ministry said in July that regulators had deemed it safe to release the water, which will be gradually discharged into the Pacific ocean via a tunnel after being treated and diluted.The plan’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has said its water treatment technology – known as Alps – can remove all radioactive materials from water except tritium, which it says is harmless in small amounts.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also pointed out that nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides.South Korea and China have voiced concern about the discharge, while the Pacific Islands Forum said recently it had “grave concerns” about the proposed release.",

Soulless council unfit for purpose.”The councillor Adam Billings admitted the council had “dropped the ball” on reminding the public about the plans and shared the frustration of residents. He said: “You can appreciate if you were in my shoes, you’d be equally disappointed. It’s clearly not the standard that our local community or indeed the cabinet member expects of the council.”The council has promised that the garden will be transformed over the winter and into the spring, with more planting scheduled. It said the palms had showed signs of significant degradation in the past 20 years and work was being carried out by its contractors to upgrade the site.Public consultation in 2019 identified the Italian Gardens as a priority for restoration, but the scheme was delayed due to the pandemic.The incident mirrors a similar controversy when 110 trees were removed under cover of darkness in March 2023 in Plymouth as part of the re-landscaping of the city’s Armada Way.

Stormont’s education budget for 2023-24 was cut by £66.4m (2.5%) and the education authority is estimated to have a financial deficit of £300m. The result is the stopping of benefits such as the school holiday food grant, or “holiday hunger” payment, and less money to pay staff, repair buildings, supply books and subsidise uniforms.HealthMore than a quarter of Northern Ireland’s 1.9m population is waiting for elective care, a 185% rise since 2014 blamed on an ageing population, staff shortages, antiquated structures, Covid-19 and insufficient funding. Waiting list performance levels are “significantly worse” than other UK regions, according to the NI Audit Office. About 122,000 patients are awaiting surgery and 378,400 are waiting to see a consultant for the first time. The health service has “fallen off the cliff edge”, according to the Royal College of Nursing.PolicingSimon Byrne resigned as the PSNI chief constable in September after a series of crises. Unprecedented data breaches leaked details of more than 10,000 officers and employees, exposing them to potential targeting by dissident republicans.

It’s a deep shame that this government are not framing policy in this way, and instead making this a culture war issue – there’s no need for that. And if we don’t subsidise oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, we can have more money to spend elsewhere. As a medical student, I have experienced the decimation of the NHS.

He only published one book before he died in 2006, the celebrated Waterlog: A Swimmer’s Journey Through Britain. Later came Wildwood, the epic arboreal treatise that was topped, tailed and published after his death, and then Notes from Walnut Tree Farm, gleaned from his copious jottings about life in the Suffolk ruin he restored and continued to share with wildlife that had moved in during the years of dilapidation.Waterlog is often credited with launching the modern outdoor swimming movement, and like many others, I have travelled in Deakin’s damp footprints. I’ve visited Walnut Tree Farm, kept much as it was by the new owners, swum in the moat Deakin reinstated and walked the ancient green lane saved by his campaigning energy.The Swimmer is an unconventional biography of an unconventional person. In his introduction, the Guardian journalist Patrick Barkham explains that he effectively ripped up a 90,000-word draft he’d laboured on for two years, abandoning an attempt at definitiveness that he felt was contrary to the spirit of the man. What he delivers instead is a kind of tapestry fashioned from notes, letters and published works, with Deakin himself as principal narrator and some creative infill by Barkham writing in Deakin’s voice. Given the previous mining of his notes and recordings, much of The Swimmer will feel familiar to fans. But the first-person narration is liberally interspersed with the impressions, memories and perspectives of dozens of interviewees – friends, relatives, colleagues and associates, pupils from a short but memorable stint as a teacher of English, and lovers, of whom there were many. These perspectives stir sediment into the clear waters of Deakin’s narrative.This is not unwelcome – in any love there is that moment when the object of our admiration is revealed to be not wholly who we thought. Not more, or less necessarily, but different, muddier. Here perhaps is that moment for Deakinites. Undoubtedly we’re seeing the man more completely than before, perhaps more clearly than he saw himself. The schoolboy, the student, the ad man with a life split between London and Suffolk.",

This is worse after dark, when as many as four out of five women in Britain say that they would feel unsafe walking alone in a park, compared to two out of five men.“All these factors mean that women and girls are less likely to use parks than men and boys, a situation which has a significant impact on their lives.

The FTC is currently updating its rulebook on the sorts of environmental claims that companies can accurately make about their products.At issue is the use of the logo along with the “resin number” of different types of plastics. Resin one and two plastics, such as bottles and jugs, are the most easily recycled products, but those marked with numbers three to seven, categories that include plastic bags, styrofoam and plastic trays, are typically not recycled and are instead sent to landfills or burned.The placement of the chasing arrows symbol upon these hard-to-recycle single-use plastics “does not accurately represent recyclability as many plastics (especially 3-7) do not have end markets, and are not financially viable to recycle,” the EPA said in its comments.A new rule was needed, the agency said, to help clear up this confusion. In 2021, California passed a law to restrict the use of the logo to avoid misleading claims about recycling.Environmental groups are pushing for an end to the blanket use of the logo, too, claiming that its use amounts to “greenwashing” by companies.",

Golf course closed for climate justice.”In a statement, XR said it had carried out the action to “denounce the wasting of water by golf in the midst of one of the worst droughts in history”. It said golf courses in Spain used more water than the cities of Madrid and Barcelona combined, with each hole requiring more than 100,000 litres of water a day to maintain the greens.“We cannot allow this kind of elitist leisure pursuit to continue,” the statement said. “Spain is drying up and the rural world is suffering losses running into millions because of the lack of water for crops – all because of an entertainment enjoyed by scarcely 0.6% of the population. Rich people and their leisure activities that gobble up essential resources are a luxury we cannot afford.”While all of Spain has been in drought since January 2022, some parts of the country are more gravely affected by the lack of rain than others.

Colombia was the most deadly country, recording 60 murders.Indigenous communities were disproportionately represented in the figures, making up 34% of all murders, despite representing about 5% of the world’s population.

The prime minister is facing pressure from emboldened backbenchers eager to press home the case for airport growth to boost the UK economy.A Department for Transport spokesperson said on Sunday: “Airport growth, and the aviation sector as a whole, has a key role to play in boosting our global connectivity and helping grow the economy. We remain supportive of airport expansion where it can be delivered in a sustainable way.”But while hostility to London’s ultra-low emission zone might have been key to the Tories winning the recent Uxbridge byelection, the party was warned that a temptation to sacrifice climate policies on other fronts would cause a backlash.“Rather than Uxbridge, they should be looking at what happened in the local elections recently where you saw a surge in Tory councillors losing their seats and being replaced by Lib Dems, Greens and others as a result of very real concerns about the climate crisis,” said Sally Pavey of CAGNE, who added that MPs in corresponding Westminster seats should be “very nervous”.Tory-held seats where airport expansion could be a factor among some voters include East Surrey, where a majority of just over 24,000 is being defended by Claire Coutinho, who was appointed by Sunak last week as the new energy secretary.",

An official review in April found Australia was recycling just 18% of plastic packaging, and would fall well short of a target of 70% by 2025.The minister said the call for regulation had been supported by some major companies including Nestlé, Unilever and Coca-Cola.“We need to dramatically reduce packaging waste, and the harmful chemicals that destroy our environment. We see packaging in the guts of dead birds, floating in our oceans, destroying nature as it takes generations to degrade,” she said. “Put simply, we’re making too much, using too much, and too much is ending up in landfill.”The Boomerang Alliance, a coalition of 55 environment groups, said the agreement was the first “substantial and meaningful step” to deal with waste in 20 years.“This is absolutely the right decision, and a key first step to tackle the growing waste and plastic pollution harming the oceans and climate,” the alliance’s director, Jeff Angel, said.",

The ever-increasing signs of climate collapse make for heart-thumping reading, while our daily dose of record-breaking temperatures, severe water shortages and crop failure only add to the litany of looming disaster. Yet we continue with the model of “business as usual” because those in whom power and money are entrenched wish to keep them so.So, what can the majority of us, who continue to bear the brunt, actually do? Protest just invites a prison sentence, while getting the media to invest a few words in the subject is seemingly impossible. Our most effective, and indeed possibly our only, tool for effecting meaningful change is our freedom to vote – all the way from local authority to national government – but with time fast running out we need those in power to be making those changes without further prevarication. Wherever you are, please use your vote wisely, because all our futures may hang on this tenuous thread.Nick MacIneskarTayvallich, Argyll and Bute It’s even worse than George Monbiot says. It’s not just the 1% or 2% dictating the conversation and policies. There’s a swathe of 25%‑40% of people in the developed world who recognise the issues and impending outcomes, but go along with the status quo in order not to take a short-term hit to consumption standards. This group is ambivalent, and ambivalence in a crisis supports inaction and failure.Also, those on the fringes working to forestall and perhaps reverse the effects of climate change need to work to change the message. The object is not to save the planet. In other epochs, this planet was fine as a burning ball of methane, and it was fine as a frozen ball of ice. As the author notes, it’s the “habitability” for humans that needs to be preserved/restored; the climate range that allowed humans to develop and prosper. The planet doesn’t need saving. It will endure. It’s the people on Earth who are endangered.",

To the three fishers already in custody for the shootings, which took place one year ago, have been added the alleged leader of a transnational illegal fishing network, Ruben Dario da Silva Villar, nicknamed Colombia (where he also has citizenship). A fourth fisher, Jânio Freitas de Souza, is alleged to have been one of Silva Villar’s henchmen on the Itaquaí river, where the killings took place.For friends and supporters of the two men’s work defending the Amazon and its Indigenous inhabitants, the investigation’s progress offers some relief. If such acts of violence go unpunished, criminal organisations that wield power in the Amazon will be further emboldened in their use. But even if convictions are secured, this will be the exception and not the rule when it comes to attacks on environmental defenders – defined by the United Nations as people who strive to protect human rights relating to nature.The risks associated with such work and activism have risen as the climate crisis has escalated. Killings linked to environmental campaigns have been monitored by Global Witness, an NGO, for a decade. It recorded 200 in 2021. For reporters, last year was particularly deadly. The Committee to Protect Journalists counted 67 victims, including Phillips. Fifteen of these were in Ukraine; almost half were in Latin America and the Caribbean. This year there have so far been 12 deaths.It is too soon to assert with confidence that President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has succeeded in ending what he called the “nightmare” of Jair Bolsonaro’s era of devastation, including deforestation and human rights abuses. What is certain is that people around the world, as well as in Brazil, need accurate information about the complex situation in the world’s largest rainforest, which plays a vital part in the climate system and is among the most biodiverse places on the planet.",

But these markets will only work properly if the credits that are traded are high-quality and both participants and external observers can be confident that they result in real removals of carbon dioxide.”Earlier this week, the Guardian revealed that rainforest carbon credits approved by the world’s leading provider were “90% worthless”.

Paella is an original one-pot wonder, an epic platter of deliciousness, and I came up with this recipe to celebrate the last of the summer tomatoes while they’re cheap, ripe and plentiful, and before they go out of season. Before you start cooking, prepare all the ingredients and have them ready to go; lay the table, too, so you’re ready to eat. A paella takes only about 18 minutes to cook, and is best eaten fresh and without delay, not least so the rice doesn’t overcook. Also, remember that the flavours will intensify as the stock is absorbed and reduces, so don’t over-season the rice during the cooking.

Swapping the office for rolling hills dotted with grazing sheep, Vickerie now raises animals and manages events on the land for a living.“The ability to be outdoors and see the seasons coming in is an absolute joy,” she says. “It’s been so good for my mental health and since I’ve always been a very busy person, I wouldn’t have done retirement well. It’s good that I’ve found another busy job to do.”Not much of Vickerie’s life has gone according to a plan. Growing up in London in the 1970s, she dreamed of training as a vet but was instead encouraged by her headteacher to enrol in teacher training college and soon began working at a secondary school. She then relocated to South America to teach, before returning to London in the 1980s and the world of local educational policy, eventually working her way up to become senior education officer for the borough of Tower Hamlets.“My philosophy was always to go through the open doors that presented themselves,” the 69-year-old says. “But I never imagined I’d end up leaving the city altogether for a different life.”Her route to rural living began with romance.

Nearly a quarter of the cars in the wealthiest part of the borough fell into this category, against 5% for the more deprived part.The research comes amid increasing concern about the environmental, health and safety impact of the increasing popularity of SUVs, often very large four-wheel drive vehicles that can routinely weigh more than two tonnes.While the definition of an SUV can vary, the proportion of cars sold in the UK that come under the banner has risen in recent years from about a fifth to almost a third.While they are billed as vehicles that cover rough ground or tow heavy loads, previous research has shown that three-quarters of SUVs bought new in the UK are registered to people living in urban areas.The effect of rising sales of SUVs, and the fact they tend to be notably heavier than the traditional models previously bought, means the average conventional-engined car bought in 2023 has higher carbon emissions than its 2013 equivalent, the study calculated.The report called for a distinction between drivers being charged based on greenhouse gas emissions rather than for emissions with direct public health effects, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx).",

Indeed, it’s been possible, on damp and squally, old-fashioned British July days (and provided you closed your ears and eyes to the unnerving news coming in from Rome and Xinjiang), to pretend that the climate crisis was no more than a fever dream. That’s not been an option for southern European winemakers, of course, who have once again been battling with the brutal effects of extreme heat, which range from the dramatic (wildfires) to the quietly devastating (much-reduced crops and quality). Those winemakers know that some grape varieties cope better in a heatwave than others: the vermentino of central Italy and southern France, for example, has a remarkable ability to yield breezily fresh, gently floral, citrussy dry whites such as Ecclesa in the dazzle and blare of a Sardinian summer.Taste the Difference Garnacha, Campo de Borja, Spain 2021 (£8, Sainsbury’s) Vermentino’s capacity to retain freshness and acidity will be sorely tested this year when the temperature across its traditional production zones has soared far above 40C at times. That it can thrive in the heat has made it an attractive choice for growers looking to plant in warm regions all over the world, with particularly successful examples emerging from Australia. The same is increasingly true of another white variety that has developed over centuries in hot, arid, windy conditions: the assyrtiko of the Greek island of Santorini, prized for an electric acidity and mouthwatering mineral quality that is more commonly found in northern European whites such as riesling and the chardonnay of Chablis, can now be found in South Australia, California, Lebanon, South Africa and the South of France – the sort of places where another sun-and-wind-loving variety, the red garnacha (aka grenache), makes abundantly, vividly berry-juicy reds such as Sainsbury’s northern Spanish bargain.Real Companhia Velha Quinta das Carvalhas Tinto, Douro, Portugal 2018 (£18.99, dbmwines.co.",

There is currently no cure for the disease, which in parts of the US has been found in a quarter of hives, requiring beekeepers to destroy and burn any infected colonies and administer antibiotics to prevent further spread.“It’s something that beekeepers can easily recognize because it reduces the larvae to this brown goo that has a rancid stink to it,” said Keith Delaplane, an entomologist at the University of Georgia, which has partnered with Dalan for the vaccine’s development.The vaccine works by incorporating some of the bacteria into the royal jelly fed by worker bees to the queen, which then ingests it and gains some of the vaccine in the ovaries. The developing bee larvae then have immunity to foulbrood as they hatch, with studies by Dalan suggesting this will reduce death rates from the disease.“In a perfect scenario, the queens could be fed a cocktail within a queen candy – the soft, pasty sugar that queen bees eat while in transit,” Delaplane said. “Queen breeders could advertise ‘fully vaccinated queens.’”American foulbrood originated in the US, and has since spread around the world.

But there are now more than 1,000 certified businesses in the UK, including several drinks companies such as Innocent and Sipsmith gin.To become a B Corp-registered company, you have to tick a lot of boxes. The certification covers the way you treat your staff and the social and environmental impact of the way you run your business, and also requires you to be transparent about it.

Its spots – seven, if you are in Europe – symbolise Mary’s seven sorrows, its red shell the cloak she wears sometimes, when she is feeling passionate or loving, or devoted to her son, or, when she’s in a particularly generous mood, devoted to all of humanity.Ladybirds come from the coccinellid family of beetles, the name for which comes from the Latin for scarlet. They were given this title by Pierre André Latreille, a priest who had grown up an orphan and was thrown into a dungeon during the French Revolution and released because he recognised a rare species of beetle.The story starts like this: a physician had come to inspect the prisoners, and found Latreille preoccupied by an insect. Then the story begins to sound like a Bible passage written by AI. The insect was very rare, Latreille told the physician. (It was a “red-necked bacon beetle”). The physician took the beetle to a well-connected local teenager, a naturalist who was so impressed by the discovery that he used his connections to get Latreille released from prison. Within a month, every other inmate was dead from “a notorious killing frenzy”. (As they say: God loves beetles.)A sheep: the mascot of changing seasons | Helen SullivanRead moreIn English, ladybirds used to be ladycows. In French, Polish and Irish they are still sometimes called variations on “little cows of God”. In Welsh, they are “short red cows”. In Romanian, best of all, they are ladyhens. The bird bit is harder to pin down. It may be because ladybirds fly.And O, how they fly: it never gets old, to see a ladybird bumbling along, then watch as it opens its forewings (elytra), which are finer than you can ever remember, can ever manage to hold in your head. They shine; they would seem to be made of porcelain if porcelain could be that fine, as tiny as a baby’s fingernail buffed to a high shine.",

But of these, the poll said, 53% would be likely to buy one if there was a hypothetical subsidy of £250 on a £1,000 model.The study used the Department for Transport’s so-called propensity to cycle tool, based on detailed data about work trips and used to inform decisions on cycling schemes, to calculate that mass bike infrastructure and access to e-bikes could prompt up to 25% of commuting trips to be made by bike.Such a switch would produce overall economic health benefits in England and Wales of £2.2bn a year, most of this coming from better health due to e-bike use, but also because of lower levels of staff absence through illness.While e-bikes provide less of a health benefit per mile than unpowered bikes, studies have shown that users tend to end up with similar overall levels of physical activity because e-bike riders travel longer distances on average.The latest study found that promoting e-bike use would mean a particular rise among people who live in more rural or hilly areas.Both the £2.",

The discovery of a species that was abundant in the age of the dinosaurs but which was thought to have disappeared from large swaths of North America has stoked speculation that there may be entire populations tucked away in remote parts of the Ozark mountains.US farmers face plague of pests as global heating raises soil temperaturesRead moreThe giant lacewing was found by Michael Skvarla, director of Penn State’s insect identification lab. In a report on the university’s website this week, he explained that he made the discovery in 2012, when he was a doctoral student at the University of Arkansas.“I remember it vividly, because I was walking into Walmart to get milk and I saw this huge insect on the side of the building,” Skvarla said.“I thought it looked interesting, so I put it in my hand and did the rest of my shopping with it between my fingers. I got home, mounted it, and promptly forgot about it for almost a decade.”In a co-authored paper recently published in the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington, Skvarla said that the specimen was incorrectly labelled in his personal collection as an “antlion”, an insect with similar features.The correct designation of the lacewing had to wait until late 2020, when Skvarla was teaching a Zoom class on biodiversity during the Covid lockdown. As teacher and students stared down at microscopic images, they realized the specimen had been wrongly labelled.“All of a sudden, out of nowhere, this incredible new record pops up,” Louis Nastasi, a member of the class, told Adrienne Berard, author of the Penn State report.",

However, Shapps stressed that the figure was “not a spending commitment” and a process will begin this year to select “probably between two and four technologies” to build.A number of manufacturing firms including Rolls-Royce, NuScale and Hitachi are developing competing SMR technologies.",

But unlike his colleagues, he was in a unique position to make his views felt. During her brief premiership, Liz Truss had effectively made him the UK net zero tsar, tasked with writing a comprehensive review of the country’s progress towards achieving the legally binding target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Now Skidmore, one of the co-authors with Truss and the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng of the notorious rightwing Britannia Unchained tract, has delivered a stinging broadside against the government he is leaving.His review argues that the Conservatives have failed on nearly every aspect of net zero policy. Though it is cloaked in polite language, and couched in terms of constructive suggestions rather than hard-hitting new policy demands, there is little in its 320 pages to show the government is on track on any of the wide range of policies needed, on areas from transport to housing, farming to energy generation.“From a former Tory minster, this is a very significant clear-eyed analysis of what is missing from government policy,” said Polly Billington, the chief executive of UK100, a group of local government leaders that campaigns for climate action. “This is a strong critique of the shortcomings on net zero.”Across the areas of policy that are key to meeting emissions target, Skidmore records failure after failure. Renewable energy growth has been hampered by government U-turns and dithering, he notes. Homes are leaking heat because of the government’s refusal to enact insulation programmes, and new ones are still being built with no regard to net zero standards. Land use is confused and farmers are not being helped to make low-carbon choices. Transport policy emerges from this critique as more or less an abject mess, though Skidmore skimps on the recommendations he could have made to rectify it.Yet his review also makes it clear that net zero offers huge economic potential for the UK.",

They then genetically tweaked another species that normally reproduces sexually to do the same.“We’re the first to show that you can engineer virgin births to happen in an animal – it was very exciting to see a virgin fly produce an embryo able to develop to adulthood, and then repeat the process,” said Dr Alexis Sperling, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and first author of the paper outlining the study.The research, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted over six years and used 220,000 flies.The researchers first looked at a species of fruit fly called Drosophila mercatorum, and its ability to reproduce through virgin births, or parthenogenesis.By sequencing the fly’s genome, and identifying the gene involved in virgin birth, the researchers were able to identify the corresponding gene in another species of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and alter that gene to turn it on.The team found the genetically manipulated female flies usually waited about 40 days in case they found a male to reproduce with before triggering a virgin birth instead.The offspring of such genetically modified flies were able to reproduce either by mating with males or through virgin births.Sperling said that switching to virgin birth could be hugely beneficial for the species and serve as a reproductive backup for isolated females.But she noted there was also a potential negative, as virgin births might reduce the ability of the species to adapt to environmental pressures.And Sperling added there could be another issue:“If there’s continued selection pressure for virgin births in insect pests, which there seems to be, it will eventually lead to them reproducing only in this way,” she said.“It could become a real problem for agriculture because females produce only females, so their ability to spread doubles.",

Here are the wedge issues the Tories are expected to deploy against Labour to paint them as “anti-motorist”:Electric carsSunak’s controversial delaying of climate pledges was a huge moment and the headline was the delay to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by five years to 2035. While it led to international condemnation, it allows the Tories to attack Labour as the party who will force voters to buy electric cars sooner - Sunak has already signalled that he wants to turn it into a cost of living issue. Labour has said it will reinstate the ban should it win the next election and has already argued businesses have been investing with that target in mind.The 20mph limit in WalesSunak has cited the decision by the Welsh Labour-run administration to make the speed limit in built-up areas 20mph as an example of the anti-motorist instincts of Starmer’s party. The Tories are likely to claim Labour will roll out the move nationwide, though it has no plans to do so. The move was introduced to reduce deaths and noise and encourage people to walk or cycle. However, it has proved to be a controversial measure and large petitions have been run opposing it. The Tories have previously attempted to attack Labour based on its performance in Wales, including on NHS waiting times.UlezIt was the narrow Tory win in the Uxbridge by-election, largely based on its opposition to the extension of London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), that appears to have led to the new pro-car strategy from Sunak. Despite winning the contest by less than 500 votes, it continues to shape No 10 thinking. Labour’s London mayor Sadiq Khan has continued to defend the policy and with similar schemes being planned in cities across the country, it is another area in which the Tories will seek some electoral advantage.",

Beef cheeks are a lean but tough cut that needs a low and slow approach to tenderise it (which may explain why most beef cheeks are processed into mince, animal feed or simply thrown in an incinerator). I’ve modified Koffmann’s original, using a smaller quantity of a different meat – in this case venison or lamb steaks – and more vegetables, to keep costs down, to increase the nutritional variety in the dish, and to make it work as a way to use up an open bottle of red wine (the original uses far more than most people would ever have left over).Red wine-braised venisonPierre Koffmann may be a fine-dining chef, but this dish has its origin in French peasant cuisine. In my recipe, I’ve tried to honour his refined approach while at the same time simplifying the dish by making it in one pot and with zero waste. Instead of beef cheeks, I’m using venison or lamb steaks, which are still relatively economical. The lean, tender and flavoursome meat from a deer is similar in quality to a beef cheek, though you could also make it with another economical beef cut such as shin, brisket or chuck, although if you do, ideally use pasture-reared beef for sustainability and nutritional reasons. To save energy, I’ve braised everything on a stove top instead of in the oven, though if you have the oven running already, the dish will of course cook just as well in there.",

It has prompted Japan’s government to summon the Chinese ambassador and urge caution among its China-based citizens.Japan began its release of more than 1m tonnes of water on 24 August. The process, which is expected to take decades, has been approved by the UN atomic watchdog and mirrors similar wastewater releases by other countries including China. However, several countries have expressed concerns or objections, with China and Hong Kong announcing bans on importing Japanese seafood.The release of the treated water tapped into anti-Japanese sentiment in China, fuelled by government statements and state media that has loudly questioned the science behind the process, and accused Japan’s government of endangering the region.Fake or misattributed videos have claimed sea life is turning up dead on beaches, that there have been mass protests, and that a Japanese official who drank treated water from Fukushima at a 2011 press conference had died. Some examples collated by an Australian-based China analyst, Han Yang, on X, formerly known as Twitter, included footage of a rally in South Korea reported by Chinese state media as being in Japan, and fake news about a Japanese politician apparently suggesting Chinese visitors should be made to eat shellfish from Fukushima.News articles have also reported panic buying of salt in the belief that iodine will provide protection from radiation, and of Geiger counters to detect radiation.A study by the UK-based data analysis firm Logically found there were high volumes of state media reports and paid advertisements in multiple languages about the risk posed by the wastewater.

It’s kind of our achilles heel really – three years ago we lost 10,000 tonnes of soil in 10 minutes. I am just full of shame for that. It happened on my watch, I don’t want to be responsible for it happening again.”Singh-Watson said he has enjoyed his recent foray into growing nuts, and loves them so much that he eats them for breakfast every morning. He said they were easy to grow: “You don’t have to do anything, I spent 40 years trying to coax vegetables into life and they just die all the time, but hazels grow so well. There doesn’t seem to be any problem growing walnuts in our climate.”He has had success grazing cattle in the orchards, and now plans to grow kale among some of his hazel trees.England’s climate is heating up, with last year the hottest on record, with a long, dry summer. This is making many crops difficult to grow, and many farmers reported crop failures during the drought.Though they sometimes need irrigation when first planted, nut trees do well in warm weather and can survive dry summers. Singh-Watson said he had recently visited Piedmont in Italy, where hazelnuts are a major crop – it is home to Ferrero, the company that makes Nutella. Despite the hot, dry summer in Italy, the nuts were flourishing.Tom Tame, who has been growing walnuts in Warwickshire for 30 years, said the hotter, drier climate was helping.",

On Friday, different tears fell. Messages flooded my phone announcing that the right to wild camp on Dartmoor had been overturned in an astonishing defeat.The now infamous high court case in London, instigated by the hedge fund manager Alexander Darwall, saw victory for landowners, who can now choose to grant (or not to grant) campers a quiet night under the stars. Now, there is nowhere to legally wild camp in England or Wales. The windswept fury of Dartmoor was the stage of its extinction.Until Friday, an assumed right to wild camp under a bylaw in the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985 saw thousands of people enjoying this most basic, fundamental form of human recreation – without having to seek landowners’ permission. The rules of the countryside code were simple: pitch your tent away from the road as the light fades, no open flames, and leave in the morning without a trace.For Darwall, Dartmoor’s sixth-largest landowner, the right to wild camp in England’s largest national park never existed. For someone like me, who has spent a young lifetime walking Dartmoor’s landscape, what does that mean? The friendships formed in howling winds and under red skies, the boy I met and will marry, the questions I’ve yelled, the answers I’ve found, the shelters from the storm – were they all in my head?This loss leaves the kind of grief that only nature can muster – and sustain. This grief is fuelling a wildfire of outrage in all who have been touched by the moors. A crowdfund to assist Dartmoor National Park Authority in appealing against the verdict has been shared by millions online since Friday and is gaining impressive momentum.People are right to be angry. Britain’s wildlife, and the right to enjoy it, are under attack. Britain has lost more biodiversity than any other G7 nation, and ranks bottom in Europe for nature connectedness.",

Miami, and Miami Beach, cities often cited as ground zero for the climate emergency, frequently see flooding during high tides. Property insurance rates throughout Florida, which Noaa says has experienced more than 40% of all US hurricane strikes, have soared in recent years.",

        "text": "The World Bank poured billions of dollars into fossil fuels around the world last year despite repeated promises to refocus on shifting to a low-carbon economy, research has suggested.The money went through a special form of funding known as trade finance, which is used to facilitate global transactions.Urgewald, a campaign group that tracks global fossil fuel finance, found that the World Bank supplied about $3.7bn (£2.95bn) in trade finance in 2022 that was likely to have ended up funding oil and gas developments.Heike Mainhardt, the author of the research, called for reform of the World Bank and its private finance arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), to make such transactions more transparent and to exclude funding for fossil fuels from its lending. “They can’t say that they are aligned with the Paris agreement, because there isn’t enough transparency to be able to tell,” she said.Fossil fuel companies would take advantage of this, she added. “They can see that they can access public money this way, without drawing attention to themselves, and they’re very clever, so they will do this,” she told the Guardian.Trade finance is a form of funding more opaque than standard project finance. Whereas project finance usually flows to governments, organisations or consortiums for a particular well-defined purpose and is relatively easy to track, trade finance is more diffuse.It comprises numerous complex financial instruments used by banks and other financial institutions to provide working capital to governments or businesses. Trade finance can take the form of credit or guarantees, and is an important tool for the World Bank as it helps to “de-risk” financing to developing countries, which are often penalised by higher than normal interest rates when they try to raise finance privately.For instance, if an oil developer in Nigeria wanted to import drilling or refining equipment, trade finance could provide a guarantee to the equipment manufacturer that the payment for the goods would be made. There is no way of knowing whether such a transaction has taken place, however, as the IFC does not disclose such detail.",

I was able to escape the crocodile’s grip once again and swim to the safety of the boat which was coming after they heard our screams for help.”McGowan estimated the crocodile was a 2-3 metre-long juvenile. The keen surfer and diver was taken by boat to Haggerstone Island 45 minutes away, before being flown by helicopter to Thursday Island hospital. He was later transferred to Cairns hospital for treatment of scalp lacerations and puncture wounds on his head and hand.“When you enter the marine environment, you are entering territory that belongs to potentially dangerous animals, such as sharks and crocodiles,” McGowan said. “I was simply in the wrong place, at the wrong time.”People who escape crocodile attacks usually frighten the reptiles, Billy Collett, the operations manager at Australia Reptile Park, said.“Crocodiles are the hardest-biting animal on the planet,” he said. “But when people do fight back, they seem to let go. He probably scared the croc which realised it grabbed something too big to handle.”The Queensland science department is investigating.“It is important that crocodile sightings and crocodile incidents are reported in a timely manner,” the department said in a statement. “Crocodiles in the open ocean can be difficult to locate as the animals often travel tens of kilometres per day.",

Most prominent among the Restore Trust-backed candidates is Lord Sumption, a former supreme court judge, who has said the NT’s influence and power for good is being undermined by “disputes about [its] mission”.Last year, none of the seven candidates backed by Restore Trust won seats on the council.In 2022-23, the NT funded 13,245 hours of work on delicate historic collections in its two dedicated conservation studios as part of an ambitious programme to protect the heritage in its custody. It spent £25.6m on “significant acquisitions”.The NT’s income from legacies topped £70m and its secondhand bookshops turned a profit of £2.5m.Membership rose very slightly from 5.71 million in 2021-22 to 5.73 million in 2022-23. The cost of individual membership increased by 16.5% from March this year to £84 a year.Hilary McGrady, the NT’s director general, said: “The record funds we dedicated in the last financial year reflects the NT’s enduring commitment to the beautiful historic places in its care, and the nation’s enthusiasm for this.“We were able to make this significant investment during a particularly difficult economic environment, with rising costs and continued recovery from the pandemic, thanks to the millions of people who supported our cause.”Rising costs included a doubling of the NT’s energy bill to £11m a year, said John Orna-Ornstein, its executive director of curation and experience.",

But working from home had another unexpected effect: less waste paper from offices, which means less recycled material to make toilet roll.New research by Ethical Consumer magazine shows that the three main toilet brands have cut the amount of recycled paper in their tissues. It said the use of virgin wood pulp was fuelling deforestation, although paper-industry advocates dispute this.The consumer organisation recommended that people avoid buying Andrex, Velvet, Cushelle, Regina and Nicky because more material used to make them is taken from felled trees.It found that Kimberly-Clark, which makes Andrex, cut the amount of recycled fibre it uses for tissue and personalcare products to 19.3% in 2021, down from 29.7% in 2011.It used less fibre, down from 3.53m tonnes to 2.85m, but almost all the reduction was in recycled fibres, while virgin-pulp use fell only slightly.Sofidel, maker of Regina and Nicky, cut recycled fibres from 8.9% in 2019 to 7.3% in 2021.And Essity, which makes Velvet and Cushelle, cut the amount of recycled paper in its products from 2.1m tonnes in 2018 (40%) to 1.9m tonnes in 2022 (36%) while it increased slightly the amount of fibre taken from pulp.Shanta Bhavnani, a researcher at Ethical Consumer and the author of the report, said: “There’s so much awareness now of the importance of trees in addressing climate change so it’s really disappointing to see the big toilet paper companies cutting their use of recycled fibres.“But it’s encouraging to see the growth in the number of alternative toilet paper products, as it means consumers now have many more sustainable options.”She cited a report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a US environmental body, that said logging in the northern hemisphere was having an impact on Canada’s boreal forests, with 11.3m hectares (28m acres) of forest felled from 1996 to 2015 – almost the size of England.",

As Earth completed the hottest month ever recorded on its surface, climate experts and engineers made it clear that only global reductions in fossil fuel burning could prevent the planet from entering an era of intense overheating.There have been proposals that still-to-be-developed global technologies could avert impending climate catastrophe and prevent temperatures from soaring. Examples include projects that could capture carbon emissions and store them underground or schemes that could deflect sunlight away from Earth.However, senior researchers say the only realistic hope for avoiding the worst impacts of climate change would be to halt the burning of coal, gas and oil. “The number one priority that we have is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources,” said Dr Greg Mutch of Newcastle University.“That is going to be critical. After you have done that, then you think about capturing any carbon emissions from industrial plants that cannot operate without producing CO2.”Examples of industrial processes that produce carbon dioxide include cement and fertiliser manufacture. These generate carbon dioxide not just by burning fossil fuels for heat but as chemical byproducts from the processes involved in making these products. Industries like these generate about 5% of all carbon dioxide emissions, so it will be worthwhile tackling them, say scientists.However, capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground – as a way to tackle the global problem of climate change – will be far trickier. Although massive amounts of carbon dioxide are emitted every year, it remains a very dilute component of the atmosphere. Around 400 parts per million of air around us is now made up of carbon dioxide. That is 0.04% of the atmosphere.“That is very, very dilute and it will take an awful lot of energy to extract that carbon dioxide. From an engineering point of view, it’s much easier to separate a gas from a concentrated mixture than it is to extract a gas that is only 0.04% of the mixture,” said Mutch.",

The UK has not put reciprocal bans in place, however, meaning damaging species from the continent could be transported in soil.Last week, it was revealed that this year has been the most prolific in England for Asian hornets, which kill native bees. There have been 45 Asian hornets, including 29 nests, seen in the country since the species was first observed in 2016, and this year there have been 22 sightings. This is a large increase since 2022, when only two Asian hornets were seen, and 2021, when there were also two sightings.The Asian hornets first came to Europe in 2004 when they were spotted in France, and it is thought they were accidentally transported in cargo from Asia. They rapidly spread across western Europe and have crossed the Channel to Britain, probably also in cargo.Thirty invasive animal species and 36 invasive plant species of concern have been identified by the government because of their ability to spread across Europe and the UK, and the harm they could cause to the environment.Matt Shardlow, the CEO of the insect charity Buglife, said that while domestic efforts to tackle invasive species such as Asian hornets had been commendable, post-Brexit biosecurity rules had not been up to scratch.He explained: “On biosecurity the government has left the door ajar. Asian hornets can arrive in growing material in imported potted plants and soil. Since Brexit the EU has banned the import of soil in pot plants from the UK; however, the UK has put no reciprocal biosecurity measures in place and indeed has recently again delayed addressing control of inward trade.“So as the Asian hornet spreads and proliferates on the continent, we are allowing their continued importation as stowaways into the UK.”While it is possible for large insects to fly across the Channel, experts say it is more likely at least some have arrived in soil from potted plants.",

Dr Sophie Lund Rasmussen, from the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) at Oxford University, who led the Danish Hedgehog Project that discovered Thorvald, said she was overwhelmed when she discovered how old he was.“I cried tears of joy that I was holding an individual that lived for 16 years. That’s really good news for conservation. Under the right conditions, hedgehogs can live for 16 years – it’s amazing. All my colleagues were laughing at me because they thought I was being so emotional,” she said. The previous record-holder was thought to be a nine-year-old female hedgehog in Ireland, identified by researchers in 2014.Unfortunately Thorvald died at Animal Protection Denmark’s wildlife rehabilitation centre in Silkeborg in 2016 after being set on by a dog, a common cause of hedgehog mortality. Rasmussen says dogs should be kept on leads or locked up at night when hedgehogs are out. “It’s very sad that he lived for so long and then died after being attacked by a dog.”Thorvald was one of almost 700 dead hedgehogs collected by 400 volunteers as part of the citizen science research. They also found a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old, according to the paper, published in the journal Animals.The bodies were sent to researchers who worked out how old they were by counting the growth lines in their jawbones, rather like counting tree rings. This research is significant as hedgehogs numbers are in decline across many European countries, their loss driven by habitat destruction, intensification of agriculture, road traffic incidents and the fragmentation of populations. In the UK, rural populations have fallen by as much as 75% in some regions in just 20 years.Hedgehog jaws are prepared for age determination.

But it won’t “be implemented on time or on budget”, with delays inflating costs even as the climate crisis adds to challenges, the commission’s interim review of the plan’s implementation has found.The review was also critical of previous Coalition governments. The decision to switch from open tenders to “limited” ones was “a slower way to recover large volumes of water”, with “weak transparency” for amounts paid between 2016 and 2019.“This report confirms what we already knew, that after a decade of sabotage under the Liberals and Nationals, the Murray-Darling basin plan is off track,” said the water minister, Tanya Plibersek. “More than 80% of the water recovered under the plan so far has been under federal Labor governments.”Plibersek’s office separately released the results of a buyback scheme to recover 44.3 GL across six catchments in New South Wales and Queensland.

As the actor Amanda Hadingue walks on to a bare stage, house lights still on, and begins to speak about coughs and Covid, it seems to be leading to another postponement.Complicité fans may recognise this unassuming start as a signature move, however, and know not to be fooled. From the simplicity of a single actor at a mic, this show directed by Simon McBurney grows like its own verdant forest. It becomes an almighty and toweringly innovative adaptation of Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk’s murder mystery eco-noir novel, written in wry, profound and glittering prose.With the help of an autocue (entirely excusable given the gargantuan burden of narration), Hadingue plays Janina, a beady-eyed, chronically sick animal lover living in a remote Polish village rocked by a series of inexplicable murders. The dead are all from the hunting club and Janina volubly espouses the theory that woodland animals are getting their revenge.Her friends – Dizzy (Alexander Uzoka), a former student; Boros (Johannes Flaschberger), an entomologist; and Oddball (César Sarachu), a neighbour – are all outsiders and non-conformists. Janina is a fabulous creation, both hero and antihero. She is a thorn in the side of the authorities, shooting off messages to the police and quoting government laws at the council – a Miss Marple, lady of letters and Fargo’s Marge Gunderson in one. Hadingue inhabits her so fully that we feel her grief over the death of her dogs – “my girls” – as an epic tragedy. Though Janina is, on the face of it, an animal rights activist, the core of this drama is about the condition of being human: how we live and age, our burdens, privileges and abuses.View image in fullscreenProjected nightmares … Hadingue in Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead.

Certainly, we’ve experienced lots of tourists coming to take photos of the blossoms and share them,” said Tom Grosvenor, a senior project manager for the National Trust in Birmingham.Japanese snack company Sakuraco recently posted a list of the best UK cherry blossom spots for its customers, including a number of London parks and National Trust sites, if they want to experience sakura (cherry blossom) abroad.“The original idea started during the first lockdown, which just so happened to coincide with blossom season. There was such an appetite for it so the programme celebrating blossom has gone from strength to strength and has become almost like a festival,” Grosvenor added.He is leading the Birmingham Blossom programme, which saw 600 blossom trees planted along the city’s number 11 bus route in January to create a “ring of blossom” around the city, with many already in bloom.The project is a reference to Birmingham’s botanical history when it was once known as a “town ringed by blossom” due to being surrounded by gardens and orchards in the mid-18th century.“We offered out blossom trees to anyone who wanted one who lived within a 25 minute walk of that bus route, so that could be residents, schools, community groups. We had a really good response,” Grosvenor said.",

But new research indicates that exposure to parks, trees and other green spaces can slow the rates at which our cells age.The study, published in Science of the Total Environment, found that people who lived in neighborhoods with more green space had longer telomeres, which are associated with longer lives and slower ageing.New York will plant thousands of trees using new tech to maximize foliage impactRead moreTelomeres are structures that sit on the ends of each cell’s 46 chromosomes, like the plastic caps on shoelaces, and keep DNA from unraveling. The longer a cell’s telomeres, the more times it can replicate. When telomeres become so short that cells can’t divide, the cells die.“Research is now showing that where we live, what we are exposed to, how much we exercise, what we eat, each of these can impact the speed of telomeres degrading and again our ageing process,” said Aaron Hipp, a professor of parks, recreation and tourism management at North Carolina State and a co-author of the study. “A longer telomere is usually a younger telomere, or a more protective, helpful telomere. It is protecting that cell from the ageing process.”Green space promotes physical activity and community interaction, which are both associated with better health outcomes. Neighborhoods with plenty of trees and greenery are also often cooler, more resistant to flooding and have lower rates of air pollution.However, Hipp noted, participants who lived in green neighborhoods that were also plagued by pollution and segregation did not have longer telomeres than similar communities with less greenery. “Green space [still] matters,” he said. “It just shows how important it is that we get to a level playing field first, so that people have the time and space to go out and enjoy green spaces.”Hipp and his colleagues looked at the medical records (that included measures of telomere lengths from biological samples) and survey responses from more than 7,800 people who participated in a national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey conducted between 1999 and 2002. The researchers connected that information with census data to estimate the amount of green space in each person’s neighborhood.",

Compared with the long-established and conclusively proven link between fossil fuels and global heating, the science of tipping points and their interactions is relatively undeveloped.The United Nations’ top science advisory body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has been more cautious. In its latest report, it said there was a chance of a tipping point in the Amazon by the year 2100.However, several prominent Brazil-based scientists, including Carlos Nobre, have warned that this may come much sooner. The new study underlines that alarming prospect. It observes that most studies until now have focused on one driver of destruction, such as climate change or deforestation. But when you combine this with other threats, such as water stress, degradation and river pollution from mining, the breakdown comes much quicker.Lake Erhai in China collapsed sooner than most observers expected. According to Willcock, this was because projections had been based on one factor – agricultural runoff that was loading the water system with excess nutrients – but other stresses compounded and accelerated this degradation. When climate variation, water management and other forms of pollution were added into the mix, the lake system quickly lost its resilience.Overall, the team, comprising scientists from Southampton, Sheffield and Bangor universities, as well as Rothamsted Research, looked at two lake ecosystems and two forests, using computer models with 70,000 adjustments of variables. They found that up to 15% of collapses occurred as a result of new stresses or extreme events, even while the primary stress was maintained at a constant level.",

Potential flash points include the retained EU law bill, the economic crime bill and the finance bill after the spring budget.One warned that Sunak would risk seeing counter-rebellions emerging that could reignite old party tensions if the same concessions were seen on other issues such as Brexit, taxation or planning.“We cannot have a situation where the prime minister is so frightened of his own party that 30 colleagues can get him to change his mind about anything,” one former cabinet minister said.Another former minister, a supporter of Sunak, said the prime minister was on shaky ground because he derived his mandate from Conservative MPs, rather than the party or from the electorate. “Losing a vote is effectively a confidence thing,” they said. “Relying on Labour votes to push anything through starts to raise all sorts of questions.”Minister refuses to rule out changes to UK online safety billRead moreOn Monday Sunak caved into demands from Tory rebels who had signed an amendment to the online harms bill that social media bosses could face criminal charges and even jail over content on their platforms.“It is genuinely bonkers,” one former minister said of the change.

Seven months on from the information commissioner’s order to publish, Southern is taking the case to the first-tier tribunal to appeal against the ruling and to keep the documents secret.First reported in Private Eye, the 53 documents relate to discussion at board level in 2020 and 2021, including agendas and minutes of meetings of the board discussing sewage spills or storm overflows.Ofwat, the industry’s regulator, has promised to apply new scrutiny to the boardrooms of water companies.Southern has tried to cite exceptions under the environmental information request (EIR) rules to defend its decision not to release the documents. But the information commissioner has said the exceptions largely do not apply and there is a public interest in releasing the documents.The company argued that the documents should remain secret because of “the need to protect Southern Water’s internal processes of deliberation and decision-making and with regard to the sensitivity of the information and the circumstances surrounding the request”. The company said the request for the documents on sewage spills or overflows in 2020-2021 related to live issues and should not be published.But the commissioner said the public interest favoured disclosing the information, and said there was even greater public interest because the company had pleaded guilty in July 2021 to 51 individual offences of discharging sewage illegally.

The researchers estimate that just 1,000 species account for half of Earth’s 800 billion trees in tropical rainforests, with 46,000 species making up the remainder.“Our findings have profound implications for understanding tropical forests. If we focus on understanding the commonest tree species, we can probably predict how the whole forest will respond to today’s rapid environmental changes,” said the lead author, Declan Cooper, from the UCL centre for biodiversity and environment research. “This is especially important because tropical forests contain a tremendous amount of stored carbon, and are a globally important carbon sink.”The team of scientists demonstrated that while African tropical forests have fewer total species compared with the Amazon and south-east Asia, their diversity follows the same pattern. The analysis is based on more than 1m tree samples across 2,048 hectares (5,050 acres) of rainforest at 1,568 locations.

As president of the Maldives, a nation of 1,138 low-lying islands south-west of India, Nasheed donned scuba gear and descended beneath the waves with 13 government ministers. The officials used waterproof pencils to sign a document urging the world to slash carbon dioxide emissions so the Maldives would not disappear beneath rising seas.The grim stakes of climate crisis for my generation are undeniable | Maya OzbayogluRead more“If the Maldives cannot be saved today, we do not feel that there is much of a chance for the rest of the world,” Nasheed told reporters.Today, Nasheed is the speaker of parliament in the Maldives and the global south’s ambassador to the Cop26 climate conference. He continues to warn that anything more than 1.5C of global warming “is a death sentence” for his country and other low-lying regions around the world. To illustrate what the last 12 years of rising temperatures have brought, he recalls the lagoon where he held that famous underwater cabinet meeting.“If you go to the same spot [today], you will see the reef is far more dead, bleached, than it was,” Nasheed said in Glasgow this week. Dead reefs lead to coastal erosion, which wipes out homes and schools and contaminates freshwater sources; the Maldives now spends 30% of its government budget adapting to climate change, including vast sums to desalinate water, he added.These are some of the human realities behind “loss and damage,” a phrase suddenly in vogue at this week’s Cop26 UN climate conference. It refers to irreversible harms that result from the higher global temperatures caused by burning fossil fuels and related human activities. The dead reefs of the Maldives, for example, will never come back to life as long as oceans are so hot – they will remain bleached for decades to come, even if countries manage to limit temperature rise to 1.5C.It’s scandalous it has taken so long for global climate negotiations to acknowledge the reality of “loss and damage”.",

The company could meet those targets by cutting emissions or buying carbon credits to offset its pollution.Opponents said the condition covered only a fraction of the total pollution expected from the extension as the vast bulk would be “scope three” emissions released after the gas was exported and burned overseas. ‘Our ancestors are in the rocks’: Australian gas project threatens ancient carvings – and emissions blowoutRead moreWoodside has estimated the development’s scope three emissions would be about 80m tonnes a year. Climate campaigners said it suggested it could be responsible for more than 4bn tonnes of additional carbon dioxide over 50 years – more than eight times Australia’s annual emissions.The head of clean transitions at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Jess Panegyres, said the North West Shelf extension would undermine Australia’s emissions reduction efforts and add to a worsening climate crisis if allowed to go ahead.She said the EPA recommendation could lead to Woodside tapping a long-promised new gas field, Browse, off the WA coast, and showed “how fossil fuel companies can exploit our weak environmental laws in their own self-interest”.“Both the UN and International Energy Agency have been very clear that there can be no new gas developments to limit global warming to 1.5C, but Woodside continues to aggressively expand its operations, even with the global gas market set to shrink as the world switches to cleaner, safer renewables,” Panegyres said. “This dangerous company does not have Australia’s economic or environmental best interests at heart.",

It also makes sense to produce our own oil and gas, so we are less beholden to exporters (though of course ours, too, would be sold on the international markets).So far, so good for Rishi Sunak’s twofold announcement today in Scotland. But it would be helpful if he did not muddy these waters by using them to score political points against Labour in the run-up to an election campaign. What we desperately need now, as we confront the climate crisis, is agreement on a way forward. Bringing party politics into it will only hinder progress.Of course, critics are right to say that where we buy our energy should not deflect attention from the urgent need to reduce demand for fossil fuels. But that issue is one of constraining overall demand, not arguing over the source of supply. Preferring to use only ship-borne oil to avoid the supposed taint of dirtying our hands in the North Sea would be hypocrisy.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a separate issue. Like power from nuclear fusion, it is one of those solutions to the climate crisis that has always been just over the horizon. But as academics such as Oxford’s Myles Allen and Edinburgh’s Stuart Haszeldine have long argued, unlike fusion, the issue is not one of science and technology. It is one of politics and money. Norway’s carbon capture operations in the North Sea have been running since 1996, and now store close to a million tonnes of CO2 every year. Denmark’s first full-scale carbon capture and storage project was launched this summer, also in the North Sea. There is nothing new in Sunak’s project other than it is British.Rishi Sunak says approving new licences for oil and gas drilling ‘entirely consistent’ with net zero plan – UK politics liveRead moreThis issue now is one of politics.

However, a 2017 law mandates another lease sale by late 2024. Administration officials said they intend to comply with the law.Two other leases that were issued as part of the first-of-its-kind sale for the refuge in January 2021 were previously given up by the small companies that held them amid legal wrangling and uncertainty over the drilling program.Alaska political leaders have long pushed to allow oil and gas drilling on the refuge’s 1.5m-acre coastal plain, an area seen as sacred to the Indigenous Gwich’in because it is where caribou they rely on migrate and come to give birth. The state’s congressional delegation in 2017 succeeded in getting language added to a federal tax law that called for the US government to hold two lease sales in the region by late 2024.Joe Biden, after taking office, issued an executive order calling for a temporary moratorium on activities related to the leasing program and for the interior secretary to review the program. Haaland later in 2021 ordered a new environmental review after concluding there were “multiple legal deficiencies” underlying the Trump-era leasing program. Haaland halted activities related to the leasing program pending the new analysis.The Alaska industrial development and export authority, a state corporation that won seven leases in the 2021 sale, sued over the moratorium but a federal judge recently found the delay by the interior department to conduct a new review was not unreasonable.The corporation obtained the seven leases to preserve drilling rights in case oil companies did not come forward.",

That was the period in which the company’s borrowings were increased towards today’s towering level of £14bn and the regulator Ofwat was reduced, more or less, to appealing for Macquarie to get out and make way for more far-sighted owners.Or was Bentley signalling that the hollowing out was worse than feared and now imperils the eight-year plan that was launched in March 2021 to “transform our company from an underperformer”? Have, for instance, the financial assumptions of two years ago been blown apart so that the newish shareholders – who injected £500m as recently as March – now fear they would be throwing good money after bad if they advance the next £1bn slug?In the absence of clear messages from the company, its shareholders or Ofwat, one can only make assumptions about how Thames could have deteriorated so suddenly to a point where the Treasury is panicked. Problem No 1 is well known: the inflationary backdrop, which is plainly an issue when the interest on slightly more than half your debt is linked to the RPI measure.But the less-publicised second problem may be heaping uncertainty upon uncertainty: it is the huge investigation by Ofwat and the Environment Agency to determine whether the industry was not treating as much sewage as it should have been at 2,000-plus treatment plants. Six companies, including Thames, are under specific attention and every legally constrained regulatory hint has suggested a major scandal. “From what we have seen so far, the scale of the issue here is shocking,” Ofwat’s chief executive, David Black, said last summer.What’s the potential bill for that one?

There are some serious, serious impacts happening.”The report, “A climate for change”, says that about 70% of the places it cares for could be at “medium or high risk” of climate hazards by 2060.The Parterre at Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire.

I worry that political timeframes, electoral cycles – none of them lend themselves really well to coping with long-term adaptive change.” But he said the trust believed new laws were needed.The report recommends that the UK government should commit to bringing in clear legal duties and targets for adaptation in the first session of the next parliament. This, it says, could include a statutory duty on public bodies to make climate adaptation a vital factor in decision-making across the UK, which it says could be modelled on measures already in place in the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act in Wales.

Only buses that are zero-emission will be allowed within the city when the entire fleet is operational, with more restrictions on other types of traffic to cut congestion as well as improve air quality.Just over half the money for the £82.5m scheme has come from Go-Ahead and Stagecoach, who put in £43.7m to buy the vehicles, with the rest from the council and government. Oxfordshire county council received a £32.8m grant from the Department for Transport’s £500m Zebra scheme to fund zero-emission buses.The partnership, in which both Go-Ahead and Stagecoach electric buses will be rebranded in the same livery, will be underpinned by further traffic measures in the city to reduce bus journey times by at least 10% compared with 2019 speeds – a contractual commitment from the council to ensure the investment is viable for the private companies.The city already has a number of “bus gates”, which prohibit most other vehicles, and more traffic filters will be introduced by the end of 2024 to push people towards public transport or active travel where possible.Oxford has already implemented several low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), which have been the focus of heated protests by campaigners and conspiracy theorists.So far, increased traffic on the edge of LTNs has slightly slowed bus speeds in the city, according to Luke Marion, managing director of the Go-Ahead-owned Oxford Bus Company, who said the company nevertheless supports the zones as a “key part of the jigsaw”. Accompanying measures to cut traffic had been delayed, partly because of major roadworks, he said, but “once the traffic filters come in, that will cease to be such a problem.",

Yet governments everywhere display more determination in suppressing protest than combating warming. As Greta Thunberg notes, “activists all over the world are experiencing increased repressions just for fighting for our present and our future”.NSW push to stop climate protesters livestreaming on Facebook labelled ‘profoundly anti-democratic’Read moreHere in Australia, the ALP’s enthusiasm for the crackdown particularly sticks in the craw, given the willingness of Labor luminaries to associate themselves with important protests of the past.A few weeks ago, for instance, Melbourne Trades Hall rightly honoured Zelda D’Aprano with a statue showing the women’s liberation icon clutching the chains with which she fastened herself to a government building during a 1969 protest for equal pay. Former PM Julia Gillard hailed Zelda’s determination – even though today Labor premiers have used “lock on” stunts to justify jail terms for environmental activists.Minns’ attempt to enlist Meta in his campaign against climate activism deserves particular scrutiny, not least because it’s all too likely to succeed.Despite rightwing bleating about the supposed “woke” bias of social media, studies show the opposite. As the researcher Paul Barrett explains, “conservatives … gain the most in terms of engagement and online attention, thanks to the platforms’ systems of algorithmic promotion of content”. Indeed, Facebook has previously shown a willingness to ban leftwing accounts when they might embarrass the powerful.These days, Meta possesses a tremendous advantage, simply because it’s not Elon Musk’s Twitter. Recent reports suggest the company intends to exploit Musk’s buffoonery with a new platform called Threads, offering what it calls a “sanely run Twitter”.Yet “sanely run” is a relative term, as Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg proved when he yesterday offered to fight Musk in a cage.The prospect of these two giant manbabies settling their commercial differences by rolling around on a jujitsu mat goes to the real problem with social media.

While electric vehicles will reduce climate-changing emissions and exhaust pollution, they will not relieve our congested roads and will not tackle air pollution from tyres, brakes and road wear.Redesigning our villages, towns and cities to favour walking and cycling can help the climate crisis, air pollution and the urban noise that plagues the lives of so many people, as well as improving our health through daily exercise. This goes beyond debates on cycle lanes and low-traffic neighbourhoods. Cities around the globe including Sydney, Portland, Paris and now many in China, are embracing the “15-minute city”. This places shops, schools, health centres and the everyday necessities of life within an easy walk, cycle or public transport trip, reducing the need for car use and home deliveries.Barcelona launches 10-year plan to reclaim city streets from carsRead moreA study from Barcelona’s Institute for Global Health adds to evidence on the benefits from reclaiming the urban space devoted to traffic.Much-quoted research from the 1980s found that recovery from surgery could be helped simply by seeing trees from the hospital window. More recent studies have found that people live longer and have fewer heart problems if they have green spaces in their neighbourhoods. The World Health Organization (WHO) therefore recommends that we have access to 0.5 hectares of public green space – about two-thirds of a football pitch – within 300 metres of our homes.The Barcelona researchers looked at satellite images of more than 1,000 European cities.",

The rare birds have historically been killed by gamekeepers and others because they predate on grouse populations, which are maintained for shooting.Members included the Moorland Association, helmed by Mark Cunliffe-Lister, the Earl of Swinton, who runs a grouse shoot on his estate. Its board also includes the viscount Matt Ridley, who owns a grouse moor and has suggested global heating is good for the planet.There is no suggestion either of them had anything to do with raptor persecution. Others in the partnership have included the RSPB, the National Trust and the Peak District National Park Authority, though the RSPB stood down from it in 2018.The group aimed to increase the number of raptors, such as hen harriers, peregrines and goshawks, to numbers seen in the 1990s. However, it failed to do so and incidents such as shooting, poisoning, trapping, nest destruction and the disappearance of satellite-tracked birds active within the Peak District have featured in every year of the initiative’s monitoring.Phil Mulligan, the chief executive of the Peak District National Park Authority, blamed illegal persecution for the endeavour ending.He said: “Featuring at the very top of local ecosystems, these species like the hen harrier, peregrine and goshawk should be a flagship for landscapes and habitats at the heart of nature’s recovery.“The fact that the work of the initiative has failed to reflect those target populations of some 30 years ago remains a cause for real concern, and it is without question that illegal persecution targeted towards some of these species is one factor behind this stuttering progress.“I would like to extend my thanks to those who have put their time, energies and passion into the painstaking study, sharing of information and analysis of our raptor populations during the initiative’s existence, but we must now look at alternative ways to ensure our birds of prey have a future in the Peak District – free from the risk of illegal actions.",

It found urban and rural services had decreased by 48% and 52% respectively – with some localities faring worse than others.The findings showed that in Hart, Fenland and Broxtowe there had been a decline of more than 80%. Other constituencies without consistent bus services were North East Hampshire, with an 82% drop in services, and Bridgwater in Somerset, with an 81% decrease. Staffordshire Moorland and Stoke-on-Trent North have experienced the same reduction in services at 78%.Mike Childs, the head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: “There has been a silent war on bus users for over a decade. This is not only disproportionately affecting those living on low incomes, people of colour and disabled people, who are less likely to own a car, but people who have had to give up their cars as they have got older due to poor health.”For the 22% of UK households without access to cars, buses are crucial. The smooth running of services also helps to lower car use, reducing carbon emissions in highly congested urban areas.Of the 100 constituencies with the greatest decline in bus services, 82 have a Conservative MP. This contrasts with analysis of bus services in London, which have stayed at similar levels for the past 15 years.The data found urban areas outside the UK capital had an average of 14 buses an hour, whereas in London the hourly average was 120.Friends of the Earth has called on all political parties to ensure a manifesto pledge for what it calls a “public transport renaissance”.",

Some days I try to swim far; others I lie on my back and watch the clouds. Then I wander up to the Prom Diner and, depending on the time, order a cortado, an ice-cream or, if the day lends itself to it, a beer. I find a seat facing the sea and bask in all of it. This is a very good life.But I cannot stay smug, because the sea has other ideas. Aberystwyth’s beaches, like those of Borth and Aberdyfi to the north, are storm beaches, which move with the sea’s weather and moods. At this time of year, they shift daily – sometimes even more often. The largely slate shingle beach that holiday folk know from summer is gone and replaced with sand.When I say it has gone, that is not strictly true: the shingle has now breached the sea wall and is mostly on the promenade around the diner, with a smattering found even on the highest parts, around the college and the castle. Within the first week of this happening, the diner boards up its ice-cream hatch. There is another week or so of coffee, then the sea hurls up a little more shingle – enough for paw and footprints to register. The shingle pools around the planters and the base of the now-closed diner.By Christmas last year, the winter storms had added such a dense layer that the council used a mini-digger to create narrow paths; the shingle piled into mounds that children loved to run up and down. Each day, the sea would throw up new finds for the new beach: a whole trunk of a tree; a boulder so impossibly large that it was hard to fathom how it had been moved, placed in such a pleasing position that people start using it as a seat.

Now all have pulled fundingRead moreThe agency has twice ignored court orders to study the impacts and is probably dodging the requirements because ethanol production “props up” the corn industry, which has a politically powerful lobby, Hartl added.“The Biden administration failed to even modestly reform this boondoggle and crumbled again in the face of political pressure from powerful special interests,” Hartl said. “Our streams and rivers will choke with more pollution and coastal dead zones will continue to expand.”The EPA said in a statement that it does not comment on ongoing litigation.About 40% of all corn grown in the US is used for ethanol production, and nearly half is used as animal feed.The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set minimum levels of biofuel usage for the transportation sector. The new rule approved by the agency calls for about 15bn gallons (57bn liters) of conventional corn ethanol for each of the next three years, plus an increase from 5.9bn gallons to 7.3bn gallons of advanced biofuels during the same time period.While the fuels are designed to decarbonize the transportation sector, their production eliminates wetlands and prairie land that act as carbon sinks, Hartl noted.

They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment.The federal government estimates virtually all Americans have some level of the compounds in their blood, but the technology to measure PFAS in blood only exists for about 40 types of the chemical.The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recently for the first time implemented recommendations on when people who have been exposed to PFAS should be offered medical testing, but it only bases its guidelines off of eight common chemicals. The academy’s report also gives advice for clinicians to reduce their patients’ exposure to these chemicals.While that approach provides good broad, population level information, Liu said, it does not take into account the thousands of other chemicals that population subsets in the US may be exposed to for varying reasons, which are accounted for under the more sensitive methodology, called item response theory.It is unclear why Asian Americans have higher levels in their blood, Liu said, adding that more research is needed. However, fish is a major source of PFAS exposure and it’s thought that populations with higher levels of seafood in their diets generally have higher levels of PFAS in their blood.",

Lost or discarded FADs can also cause environmental damage.Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise boat retrieves a fish aggregating device from the Indian Ocean. Photograph: Laurel Chor/GreenpeaceAt a tense three-day meeting of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) over the weekend to discuss the issue, a last-minute proposal to reduce the number of free floating or “drifting” FADs used by EU and other purse seine fleets, was put forward by Indonesia and 10 other coastal states. It was adopted by a two-thirds majority after a secret ballot on Sunday. The unusual move followed a surprise withdrawal of its proposal by Kenya, then the lead proponent of a temporary FAD ban, which was backed by 10 other African and Asian coastal states.Measures to be adopted by IOTC nations by 1 January 2024, include a phased reduction of the number of drifting FADs for each vessel, a mandatory FAD register, to increase transparency and monitoring of the devices and, for the first time and most controversially, a 72-day period where FADS are banned.The closure period received the most opposition from the EU, who threatened to object to the entire proposal and said on Tuesday they were still considering options.An EU commission spokesperson said they were “very concerned” about the results of the IOTC meeting.

Some of the birds had been doing this trip twice a day for 20 years, returning to the same cliff ledge, squabbling over who sat where.On 31 October, Mark Newell sat on the rock, waiting for their noisy return. He saw nothing. Eventually, 25 exhausted-looking birds straggled back. They did not fly off when he approached. The soundtrack of honking and bickering had stopped.“It was desolation,” says Newell, who works for the UK Centre for Hydrology & Ecology (UKCEH) as the Isle of May field manager. After working on the island for 20 years, he says: “Seeing the cliffs devoid of birds was a stark, alarming view.”Newell stayed for four nights, and returned weeks later, but the flocks had disappeared. These birds survived two years of avian flu – which has swept through the UK’s seabird colonies – only to disappear en masse.Experts say a series of storms in October, culminating in Storm Babet, had caused the disappearance – and likely death – of these birds. But their disappearance could be a microcosm of what is happening on other islands – and a warning of what happens to seabirds as extreme weather events become more frequent.“There are some birds out there that I’ve ringed as chicks 20 years ago,” says Newell. “A week or two of bad weather and that’s the end of them.”The seafront at North Berwick, as Storm Babet rages.

He hoped to win over voters worried that green policies would add to the cost of living.But since relaunching his premiership and axing the Birmingham to Manchester leg of HS2, the Tories have made no progress.

However, a high proportion have been negatively affected by human activities.Alan Stewart, a professor of ecology at the University of Sussex, said past construction of straightened, artificial canals to transport vessels had increased the risk of flooding, noting that Lewes had a “devastating” flood in 2000. The flood damaged more than 800 properties, including homes and businesses, and led to six days of power cuts.Stewart said removing artificial river banks and allowing streams to create their own natural winding courses was ultimately the most sensible approach to reducing flood risk.King said the Cockshut chalk stream was a site of special scientific interest that had been in “unfavourable condition for a number of years due to the decreasing biodiversity across the site”.An artist’s impression of the completed Cockshut stream restoration project. Photograph: Cockshut Stream Restoration ProjectAccording to Stewart, one of the most important outcomes of the project would be the removal of a large floating mat of parrot’s feather,, an invasive non-native plant that clogs up the stream, “outcompeting native aquatic plant species and reducing the oxygen in the water”.An ecological impact assessment has forecast that the creation of the wetland will boost the population of rare mollusc and dragonfly species that live there.",

The US has used more than four times its fair share to become the richest country in the world, and would be responsible for $80tn in reparations under this scheme.“It is a matter of climate justice that if we are asking nations to rapidly decarbonise their economies, even though they hold no responsibility for the excess emissions that are destabilising the climate, then they should be compensated for this unfair burden,” said Andrew Fanning, lead author and visiting research fellow at the University of Leeds’s Sustainability Research Institute.In order to keep global heating to below 1.5C, the total global carbon budget starting from 1960 is 1.8tn tonnes of CO2 or equivalent greenhouse gases, according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) figures.",

        "text": "Tropical forests could become so hot that some kinds of leaves will no longer be able to conduct photosynthesis, according to a study published in the journal Nature.The photosynthetic machinery in tropical trees begins to fail at about 46.7C on average. The research suggests that forests may be nearing dangerous temperature thresholds sooner than expected.Using a combination of high-resolution data from Nasa’s thermal imaging instruments on the International Space Station and ground-based experiments in tropical forests across the world, researchers found that a small fraction, approximately 0.01% of all leaves, are already exposed to temperatures beyond their functional limits.Models predict that once we hit a global temperature increase of 3.9 C, these forests might experience mass leaf damage.Warming leaves, even if now in low numbers, act as a “canary in a coalmine for tropical ecosystems”, said Chris Doughty, an associate professor of ecoinformatics at Northern Arizona University and the lead researcher of the study.He said the leaf-warming experiments had revealed a nonlinear rise in temperatures. “We were really surprised that when we warmed leaves by 2, 3 or 4C, the highest leaf temperatures actually increased by 8C. This shows a concerning nonlinear feedback that we were not expecting,” said Doughty.“If we adopt a do-nothing response to climate change and tropical forest air temperatures increase by greater than 4C, there could be massive leaf death, possible tree mortality and species turnover across all tropical forests,” he added.In terms of global impact, “the photosynthetic response would be the tip of the iceberg in terms of effects – reduced carbon uptake, likely increased mortality and even triggering possible transitions from forest to savannah”, said Mat Disney, a professor of remote sensing at University College London.At least 50% of global CO2 exchange occurs through forest canopies, which act as key regulators of our climate.“The importance of this work is that it is a first look at the specific impact of this leaf-scale warming on photosynthesis in tropical forests,” Disney said. “So while it is quite specific in one sense, it also provides a really interesting look at one of the underpinning processes in this region, and what might happen to it in the near future if we don’t act fast.",

The children had tests to measure theeir breathing power at the ages of six, 10 and 15.The researchers compared the results with estimated levels of pollution in the areas the children had lived until they were one year old. After controlling for factors including parental smoking, the researchers found that the higher the level of pollution exposure as babies, the worse their lung function was as adolescents. The impact was even greater on children who developed asthma.A second study, also presented at the congress, found that adults who were exposed to air pollution, even at low levels, were more likely to develop asthma.In a study of 23,000 Danish nurses, the researchers found a 29% rise in asthma risk for each increase of 6.3 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) in small particulate matter known as PM2.5. They also found a 16% rise in asthma risk for each 8.2 µg/m3 increase of nitrogen dioxide.The WHO limit for PM2.5 is an annual average of 10 µg/m3, and the EU limit is 25. Both the WHO and EU limits for nitrogen dioxide are 40 µg/m3.Shuo Liu, a visiting PhD fellow at the University of Copenhagen, told the conference: “The fact that we found a link with asthma, even at relatively low levels of exposure, suggests that there is no safe threshold for air pollution. This is strong evidence that our regulations on air pollution need to be stricter if we want to prevent cases of asthma.",

Extreme heat has been associated with triggering earlier deliveries and an increase in stillbirths.The report said the climate crisis exacerbated existing inequalities. In east and southern Africa, for example, tropical cyclones have damaged health facilities, disrupting access to maternal health services and helping spread waterborne diseases such as cholera.Hurricanes and droughts increase the risks of gender-based violence and child marriage, it added, as families under stress are less able to support daughters and seek to marry them off.Angela Baschieri, an adviser on population and development for UNFPA and one of the report’s authors, said: “If we look at the plan of action for women and girls, national plans show there is more work that could be done.“We know climate change disproportionately affects women and is not gender neutral so there is a need to address those gaps and impacts.”Cop26: Women must be heard on climate, say rights groupsRead moreThe report highlighted the countries that are taking action.

They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and they are linked to cancer, fetal complications, liver disease, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders and other serious health issues.Though water is considered to be a main exposure route to the chemicals, researchers are increasingly finding food to be a source of exposure. However, the Food and Drug Administration has taken few meaningful steps to protect the nation’s food supply, critics say.“When FDA falters, the law firms that are out there are going to protect their clients because the FDA is not dealing with it,” said Tom Neltner, chemicals policy director with the Environmental Defense Fund, a non-profit that pressures the agency to take stronger action on PFAS.Attorneys for the plaintiffs and Bolthouse Farms did not respond to requests for comment. The same attorneys weeks earlier filed a similar suit against Coca-Cola over PFAS in its Simply Tropical drink.Though Bolthouse’s packaging states that the smoothie is made of “100% fruit juice”, the suit says PFAS are “a category of synthetic chemicals that are, by definition, artificial”.Its testing found three PFAS compounds – PFOS, 6:2 FTOH, and PFHxS.The Environmental Protection Agency recently found virtually no level of exposure to PFOS in drinking water is safe. No limits exist for 6:2 FTOH and PFHxS because they have not been as thoroughly studied as PFOS, though independent science has linked all three compounds to many of the same health issues.It is unclear how the chemicals got in the drink, and it is highly unlikely they were intentionally added. PFAS researchers who reviewed the case told the Guardian the chemicals may have been in the fruit. Fruit could be contaminated from pesticides, water, or the use of PFAS-tainted sewage sludge as fertilizer.",

It is banned in the EU but the UK has provisionally agreed to its emergency use every year since leaving the bloc. In 2017, the then environment secretary, Michael Gove, promised to use Brexit to ban all neonicotinoids.Government scientific advisers said in September they were not able to support an authorisation for Cruiser SB, because the “potential adverse effects to honeybees and other pollinators outweigh the likely benefits”.Now a group of businesses that depend on pollinators, including some farmers and those who use botanicals in their products, have said the government must heed their advice and not allow bee-killing pesticides to be used.In a letter to Mark Spencer, the farming minister, Anabel Kindersley, the chief executive of Neal’s Yard Remedies, Tim Mead, the head of Yeo Valley, as well as the boards of Lush and the Body Shop have asked him to block Cruiser SB from use.“We need to listen to the scientists. Excessive pesticide use is killing our bees and other essential insect species that we rely on for a healthy, safe and clean environment,” they wrote.“A single teaspoon of neonicotinoid is enough to deliver a lethal dose to 1.25bn bees. One-third of the UK bee population has disappeared in the last decade, and since 1900 the UK has lost 13 out of 35 native bee species.“Many UK businesses rely on a healthy pollinator population to uphold the high standards of our products. We need sustainable agricultural practices that don’t harm our ecosystem.”Sugar beet has one of the highest profit margins of any crop grown in the UK but growers fear these could be hit by virus yellows, a disease spread by aphids, which can decrease crop production.Seeds are treated with Cruiser SB and this kills the aphids. However, the pesticide spreads into the soil, meaning any wildflower that grows in it is toxic to the bees that visit to pollinate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

Indeed, current EU legislation already enables them to do so.”It is a subject close to Von der Leyen’s heart after her pony, Dolly, was killed last September by a wolf that broke into a well-guarded compound in north-west Germany.Complaints about wolves have been growing, with some farmers’ organisations calling for the right to shoot them.A consultation process is designed to balance the interests of rewilding with commercial agriculture and public health concerns.The commission is inviting all interested parties to submit data on the experiences of member states, and is seeking to update data on the wolf population as well as how the conservation status works in practice.“The return of the wolf to EU regions where it has been absent for a long time is increasingly leading to conflicts with local farming and hunting communities, especially where measures to prevent attacks on livestock are not widely implemented,” the commission said.Wolves are a protected species under conservation laws but farmers have complained that the numbers have increased so much they no longer need such protections.They want the commission to revise the habitats directive to reflect the increased numbers of wolves, particularly in alpine and forested regions of Scandinavia and central Europe.Environmentalists have argued that instead of changing the laws to allow wolves to be culled, farmers can take preventive measures with electric fencing.The farmers’ association Copa-Cogeca estimated wolf numbers increased from just over 12,000 in 2013 to as many as 18,000 last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Police were forced to weigh the disruption of the marches against the protesters’ rights to political speech.A change to the definition of “serious disruption” would empower police to intervene when protesters used the tactic, the Home Office said. “This will give police the clarity they have asked for on when to use their existing powers to break up the slow marching tactics protesters have used to halt traffic across the UK,” it said.On Friday morning, 64 Just Stop Oil supporters marched from locations in Ealing, Putney and Mile End, the campaign said.According to the Metropolitan police, in each case protesters moved out of the road after 45 minutes to an hour when officers enforced orders requiring them to only protest on the pavement.In Mile End, a man was escorted from the scene by police after snatching banners from activists and dumping them by the side of the road, MailOnline reported.Just Stop Oil denounced the government’s move. “We won’t be deterred by changes to protest laws or how strongly the police enforce those laws,” a spokesperson said. “Just Stop Oil supporters understand that this is irrelevant when we face mass starvation, mass death and the collapse of ordered human society.",

Photograph: VeoliaDonald Macphail, the chief operating officer of Veolia’s treatment​​ division, said the project would have “minimal ground-level impact”, meaning that “the wildlife that has repopulated the restored land can continue to coexist with the technology”.There could be hundreds of hectares of closed landfill sites across the UK that could play host to solar arrays, according to Philippe Queruau, the electrification services manager at Veolia UK. In addition, thousands of hectares of active landfill sites could be used for solar arrays in the future.“We’re just scratching the surface for now,” he said. “But we need a lot more solar, and landfills are a prime location.”The government aims to increase the UK’s existing 14 gigawatts (GW) of solar power capacity fivefold to 70GW by 2035.

Even low-burning hobs, or gas oven use, emit significant levels of benzene. Induction stoves emit no benzene at all, the researchers found.The peer-reviewed study, led by scientists at Stanford University, is the first to use new monitors to effectively measure benzene indoors. Even low doses of airborne benzene raise the risk of a variety of cancers, including lymphomas and leukemia, by damaging people’s bone marrow. Elevated levels of benzene can linger for six hours throughout a house or apartment after a gas stove is turned off.“I’m hard-pressed to think of a more powerful chemical cause of leukemia than benzene,” said Jan Kirsch, a California-based oncologist who said that people had in their homes a “very potent” cause of blood cell cancers.“People have died, undoubtably, from exposure to benzene in their homes and unless this problem is ameliorated people will continue to do so,” Kirsch said. “The idea is not to cause panic, but there are risks and we want to reduce them. It’s important this message is carried to the public, so we can understand and act on it.”More than a third of households in the US use gas stoves, although many lack adequate ventilation to help reduce dangerous levels of benzene, the researchers said.",

A report published last week found that dredging was unlikely to be the cause of the die-offs, suggesting an unidentified new pathogen could have been to blame, but the findings have been criticised by some scientists.The EA report paints a bleak picture of England’s coastal regions, with fewer than a fifth of the UK’s estuaries judged to be at good ecological status. Only 45% of the marine areas assessed met the standard in 2021, according to the report, published on Thursday.More than nine in 10 of the estuaries sampled had nitrogen levels that were too high in 2019, as did nearly half of coastal waters. Nitrogen pollution comes from agricultural runoff and sewage, and can cause harmful algae blooms that kill off marine life and smother seagrass and saltmarsh.The report found that there had been “widespread damage to coastal defences, properties and infrastructure” during storms, with about 100,000 people at risk of significant coastal flooding.Sand dunes were being lost to erosion, and wetlands were drying out under the influence of the climate crisis, the report found. About 85% of England’s salt marshes, a major carbon store, have been lost since the 1800s, along with about half of seagrass meadows and 95% of the native oyster population.Added to this, many people in coastal regions are enduring economic hardship.

Unlike the well known British insect, North American snow flies habitually walk across snow and ice in the wild and have been observed doing so at temperatures as low as -10C.The researchers used dozens of snow flies from four different but closely related species collected from icy, mountainous habitats in Washington state, Colorado and Vermont in the US, and British Columbia and Yukon in Canada.In their experiments, the team placed individual flies on laboratory cold plates and observed their behaviour with a thermal imaging camera as the temperature slowly dropped.The flies could still walk even when their bodies reached -7C, and the thermal imaging camera was able to capture the precise moment at which the flies’ legs began to freeze, prompting the amputation response. This happened in 31% of cases where freezing began in a leg. Some flies removed as many as five legs before succumbing to the cold.The team has published a paper online detailing their findings, though it is yet to be peer-reviewed.Other crane flies are known to self-amputate their legs – but for different reasons. They tend to do it when a predator grabs on to one of their limbs. According to Tuthill, there are muscles inside the flies’ legs that seemingly allow them to pinch off or detach a limb at will.Certain geckos, crayfish and squid can also self-amputate their limbs or tails to escape predators. The African spiny mouse can even shed huge quantities of its own skin in a tight spot.",

It’s a type of bread pudding made with pork fat instead of butter, and Ramsden’s version involves roasting pork belly on top, so the fat renders and soaks into the bread,so basting everything while it cooks.I’ve taken his dish and turned it into a speedy breakfast take on the original, a one-pot fry-up that’s a lovely way to feed a crowd with little fuss. And if you have a houseful eating breakfast as and when, it keeps well in a warm oven, too. It’s easily adaptable for vegetarians or vegans as well, by using butter or olive oil instead of the pork fat and mushrooms and tempeh instead of the meat.",

A total of 53% said they did not trust him, while 19% said they did not know.The polling company WeThink also asked respondents whether they thought forcing landlords to insulate their homes would benefit them, and 55% said it would. Sunak has dumped plans to fine landlords who do not update their homes to acceptable energy efficiency standards.The Guardian poll questioned 1,313 people on 21 September and is weighted to a nationally representative population. WeThink is a member of the British Polling Council.This week, in one of his biggest policy changes since taking office, Sunak confirmed the UK would push back the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing-out of gas boilers, prompting furious condemnation from the automobile and energy industries, as well as some Conservatives including Boris Johnson and the former environment minister Zac Goldsmith.Though Sunak claims that his changes will save consumers money, this has been disputed by many experts. For instance, private renters will pay £1bn a year more in energy bills because of the scrapping of proposals to make landlords upgrade insulation on their properties, according to the Social Market Foundation.Pushing back the deadline for phasing-out sales of new petrol and diesel cars would also cost consumers money, as electric vehicles save drivers £5,000 to £8,000 in fuel costs over their lifetime, the thinktank said.The Conservatives risk losing seats in the “blue wall” of affluent, pro-remain Tory constituencies in southern England because of net zero decisions made this week, polling commissioned by Greenpeace has suggested.

Now, only one wild-born owl remains. Two captive-bred owls released last fall were found dead in May. Two more captive-bred owls were released into the wild earlier this year.Biologists have told the Guardian the species could recover with adequate protections to key habitat areas, all of which are old-growth forests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Gas prices experienced a 50% rise in 2021, reaching the highest they have been since 2014. Fuel prices have only continued to climb, hitting an average of $4.12 a gallon in the past few months.At Shell, chief executive and chief financial officer raises were made for their “significant personal contributions … in delivering the strategic progress of 2021”, said Curtis Smith, Head of Americas Media Relations at Shell, in an email to the Guardian.

Only blood pressure, smoking and diet play a bigger role in whether people die too early.Jane Burston, the executive director of the Clean Air Fund, said cleaning the air saves lives, grows economies and slows the climate crisis, adding: “It’s the single thing that has the biggest bang for your buck if you fund it.”The report found that international aid for fossil fuels peaked in 2019 and has fallen fast but still lingers. In 2021, about $1.5bn (£1.2bn) was spent on fossil fuel projects like building coal plants or gas pipelines, down from $11.9bn two years earlier. The amount spent on tackling outdoor air pollution has risen to $2.3bn.Despite this shift, spending targeted at clean air made up just 1% of international development funding and 2% of international public climate finance between 2015 and 2021, the report found.“The trend is good but the funding is increasing from a very low base,” said Burston. “It’s not increasing quickly enough,” she added.Nor has the money been spent in the places that need it most, the report found. Africa received 5% of air quality funding between 2017 and 2021, despite being home to five of the 10 countries with the highest levels of air pollution in the world. At the same time, five polluted Asian countries – China, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Mongolia and Pakistan – received 86% of the funding.Scientists are unsure just how many people are killed by dirty air each year but estimates of the death toll run into the millions just from air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels.

With the basic payment scheme falling at that point, we had to take a long hard look at the farm and become more efficient financially. Unfortunately, with the loss of the suckler herd also went the ability to use cows in the landscape as “ecosystem engineers” year-round. We had calves coming and going during the year, but no regular workforce of hardy cattle.We had also lost the ability to provide our own beef for our family, so this year I decided to buy some young belted Galloway cattle with a view to building up a small herd. The idea was to become more self-sustainable, provide for our family and sell the excess meat to our neighbours. Besides, my husband had also promised me three hairy cows (hardy native breeds that can survive our climate) as a much-delayed Christmas present, which was cunning of him since he knew I was going to buy them anyway at the Galloway show and sale in Carlisle in March.I pored over the auction catalogue all week, but when the day came, the farmer did not bring the ones I hoped to buy, so I had to dash around all the pens. My son was at home on the farm, so I did a video call as I walked along the pens, showing him what was on offer. We agreed on the ones we wanted, but he said: “You’ll not get them – too expensive.”I slid along the benches at the ringside to join a friend I had spotted. “You don’t have Galloways,” she said, surprised at my attendance. The prices were not great. I saw some lovely cows come and go, but held out for the very last three in the ring.",

This will reduce the value of carbon-heavy assets including shares or loans for fossil fuel projects or their related companies, which will in turn harm the institutional investors like bank, insurers and fund managers that hold them.Globally, the report estimates that banks would probably need a total of $4.9tn in international bailouts if fossil fuel assets collapsed in 2030, putting 13.6 million jobs at risk worldwide.One for One campaign, which is backed by groups including Positive Money UK and the Sunrise Project, is calling for coordinated action from governments and financial regulators to address what it says are critical weaknesses in the banking and insurance sectors. That would involve banks and insurers holding one pound worth of capital in reserve to match every pound used to finance or insure fossil fuel projects.“If we don’t have rules in place to ensure fossil fuel financing is backed by adequate levels of capital, it will be impossible to transition to a low carbon economy without triggering serious financial instability,” Joshua Ryan-Collins, an associate professor in economics and finance at the University College London’s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, said.",

Bang in the middle of the row over tweeting by the widely respected Gary Lineker, it now seems to be muzzling the most trusted Briton of them all – David Attenborough.As the Guardian reports today, it has decided not to broadcast the sixth and last programme of the veteran broadcaster’s widely hailed new series on Britain’s wildlife, in which he exposes its dramatic decline, and what has caused it. While the other five episodes of Wild Isles will go out in prime time, amid enormous hype, it will be available only to those who look for it on the BBC’s iPlayer service.Sources say that the programme, already filmed, and entitled Saving Our Wild Isles, is being suppressed for fear of antagonising rightwing groups with “dinosaur ways”. Its showing, even on iPlayer, has already been attacked in the Daily Telegraph for being partly funded by WWF UK and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, two establishment wildlife groups, which it describes as having a “campaigning agenda”.This is not the first time that the BBC has effectively silenced its greatest presenter who – after years of criticism for downplaying the threats to the world’s environment – has over the past decade become one the most outspoken and influential advocates of action to combat the climate crisis and preserve biodiversity. But it is likely to provoke the most outrage.Polls show that more than four of every five Britons believe that the country’s wildlife is under threat and urgent measures are needed to protect and restore it. Well over half lament their own personal experience of declines in insects, birds, mammals and green space.They – and Attenborough – are right.

Twenty other European countries also had higher installation rates than the UK.Heat pumps, which are powered by electricity and work rather like fridges in reverse, are considered the most efficient way for the UK to shift to low-carbon heating and away from the gas-fired boilers that heat the majority of homes. With gas prices still at high levels, heat pumps are cheaper to run than gas boilers, though more expensive to install, and could be cheaper still with further changes to the electricity market.At current rates, the UK has little chance of meeting the government’s target of 600,000 heat pump installations a year by 2028.

Lead can leach into the water from the pipes as the water travels through them.Revealed: the ‘shocking’ levels of toxic lead in Chicago tap waterRead more“There is no safe level of lead,” said Joan Matthews, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which co-authored the report as part of the New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning.A potent neurotoxic metal, lead can cross the blood-brain barrier, causing a host of neurological problems in young children, including behavioral disorders and lower IQ levels. “Lead in drinking water can be a significant exposure path, particularly for infants who are drinking formula,” Matthews said. Adults can also suffer serious consequences from lead exposure, including high blood pressure and kidney damage.Brooklyn and Manhattan are the boroughs with the highest estimated number of lead service lines, at 46% and 44% respectively. Nearly a quarter of all water lines in the Bronx are confirmed to have lead. At a neighborhood level, Staten Island’s Port Richmond community has the highest concentration of lead water lines in the entire city, at roughly 61%.The new report is based on data from the city’s department of environmental protection (DEP), which includes a publicly accessible map of every property in the city. The report identified water lines as “possible lead” if there is no record or conflicting records about the material type.New York City banned lead pipes in 1961 as public awareness of the dangers of lead exposure grew, and a national ban went into effect in 1986. But pre-existing lead service lines remain in use.",

The Environment Act passed into law in November 2021, although its provisions against illegal tree felling are not yet in force.Under existing laws, illegally felling 12 oak trees, all about 150 years old, attracted a fine of just £15,000 in January 2020. The case, prosecuted at Hastings magistrates court, was remarkable for resulting in one of the biggest fines in recent years.“These new powers will hit people where it hurts – in their wallets,” said the Forestry Commission’s chief executive, Richard Stanford. “By guaranteeing that illegal felling is no longer a financially viable option for offenders, these measures are a significant step forward in the fight against this offence and will help in our endeavours to fight the climate emergency and nature crisis.”The changes also mean a failure to replant illegally felled trees after a court’s restocking order could result in a prison sentence.Selling land developed through illegal felling will also be made less lucrative, with restocking notices and enforcement notices listed on the local land charges register – potentially reducing the land’s value in the eyes of buyers.But critics question whether the harsh penalties will be meted out often enough to be an effective deterrent. Last month the Guardian revealed only 15 of 4,002 alleged illegal felling cases reported to the Forestry Commission resulted in a successful conviction between 2012-13 to 2021-22.The Forestry Commission, a non-ministerial government department, said its count of alleged wrongdoing is inflated by members of the public misreporting.",

That has now started to come off. The price of thermal coal fell sharply over the first three months of this year, but the total value of thermal coal exports this financial year is still expected to reach $65bn.By 2027-28 it is expected to be at the same level as lithium – about $19bn. Like fossil fuels, lithium prices rose in the past year as demand outstripped supply. They are expected to reach nearly $19bn this year before falling as more mines start operating, then begin a gradual rise in the years ahead.Australian exports of lithium and thermal coal Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The rise of lithium is being significantly driven by the predicted tenfold growth in electric vehicle sales between now and 2030. Australia is the world’s largest lithium exporter. It was responsible for more than half of global production last year.About 80% of the lithium dug up in Australia is used to make rechargeable batteries and this proportion is expected to reach 90% as EVs become popular.",

It started to become so about 10 or 15 years ago, when the look of artificial turf was improved. Then there was a sudden surge of interest during lockdown, with installers reporting record sales.Summer picks: should we ban artificial grass? – podcastRead moreAnd now? Now the fake grass backlash is fully under way. Demand in Britain in 2023 is down 66% on 2021 figures, and people are sorely regretting their plastic lawns.Why? What’s wrong with evergreen, maintenance-free grass? It’s not maintenance free. You may not have to mow it, but you do have to vacuum it. Otherwise leaves just sit on top.That’s a chore I hadn’t reckoned with. Artificial grass also doesn’t drain well. It soaks up and retains the smell of dog urine. And it gets so hot in summer it burns your feet.I’m still stuck on the idea of hoovering the outdoors. Fake grass is also more expensive to lay than actual grass, and yet it can lower the value of your home by up to 5%.Do you use, like, a regular vacuum, or is there a special grass one? On top of all that, artificial lawns are seen as an environmental disaster, usurping habitats for insects and wild plants.For the owners, presumably that’s part of the attraction – no bugs, no weeds. Yes. That’s why the Springwatch presenter Chris Packham described artificial grass as the “horticultural antichrist”.Is that possibly a bit strong? Maybe not. People with artificial lawns have also been asking councils to remove overhanging trees and shrubs that deposit leaves, to cut down on all the vacuuming.Idiots! We should ban them. It’s a popular idea. According to a survey from Mybuilder.com, 24% of Britons would like plastic grass to be banned.I was actually suggesting a ban on idiots, but I can see that would be impractical. The Welsh government also briefly considered a ban, while environmental campaigners have called for a tax on artificial lawns.",

Plainly they could have been struck by fast-moving vehicles with obvious severe consequences,” said the prosecutor Simon Jones. “We say that their actions also caused risk to the drivers themselves and the marshals.”All six defendants gave evidence denying the charges, with McKechnie saying the protest was planned “to be as safe as possible” and he had “watched every single race that’s been held at Silverstone over the last 20 years” as part of his research.“I scoured the internet for every piece of information I could get about the track, the red flag system and also the drivers,” he said. “We picked a part of the track which would give the cars plenty of time to pass where we were and where the racing line was on the far side of the track.”He said the group had carried out “meticulous” planning over two and a half months, and had planned to enter the track only when a red flag was raised. “We used that understanding to plan it [the protest] to be as safe as possible,” he said.",

        "text": "Climate litigation poses a financial risk to fossil fuel companies because it lowers the share price of big polluters, research has found.A study to be published on Tuesday by LSE’s Grantham Research Institute examines how the stock market reacts to news that a fresh climate lawsuit has been filed or a corporation has lost its case.The researchers hope their work will encourage lenders, financial regulators and governments to consider the effect of climate litigation when making investment decisions in a warmer future, and ultimately drive greener corporate behaviour.The study, which is currently being peer reviewed, analysed 108 climate crisis lawsuits around the world between 2005 and 2021 against 98 companies listed in the US and Europe. It found that the filing of a new case or a court decision against a company reduced its expected value by an average of 0.41%.The stock market responded most strongly in the days after cases against carbon majors, which include the world’s largest energy, utility and materials firms, cutting the relative value of those companies by an average of 0.57% after a case was filed and by 1.5% after an unfavourable judgment.Although modest, the researchers conclude that the drop in the value of big polluters is statistically significant and therefore down to the legal challenges.“We didn’t know before if the markets cared about climate litigation,” said Misato Sato, lead author of the study. “It’s the first evidence supporting what was suspected before; that polluting firms and especially carbon majors now face litigation risk, in addition to transition and physical risk.”Researchers also found share prices fell more in reaction to novel cases involving a new form of legal argument or filed in a new jurisdiction.For example, when the Peruvian farmer and mountain guide Saúl Luciano Lliuya filed an unprecedented legal claim against RWE in 2015, seeking compensation for its role in causing historical climate change that threatens his home, the German energy giant’s relative value fell by 6%.

        "text": "A study has concluded that air pollution is accelerating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.Researchers scanned the bones of more than 9,000 women living in four different parts of the US. Each had a bone scan three times over a six-year period that was compared with the air they breathed. On average, air pollution accounted for a doubling of the speed of bone loss.In the US, 10 million people are thought to have osteoporosis, of whom about 80% are women. The condition weakens bones and is linked to more than 2m fractures a year in the US, with a cost of more than $20bn (£16.9bn) annually. Only about 40% of these people regain full independence after their fracture. In the UK, osteoporosis affects 3.8 million people and the resulting fractures account for about 2% of total healthcare spending. Small changes in the progress of the disease or the number of resulting bone fractures could therefore have a very large impact on healthcare systems and on the quality of life for many people.The new study helps to explain earlier work by the same research group that looked at hospitalisation for fractures among more than 9 million people in the eastern US. Here the team found that particle pollution increased the number of incidents of people being taken to hospital with fractures by 8% in their study group.Importantly these studies show effects at air pollution concentrations that are well below the current limits in the US and Europe, and well below the UK government’s proposed limits for 2040.Dr Diddier Prada, from the US study team at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, said: “The global population is getting older because of increased life expectancy and declining birth rates. We should identify, and eliminate, critical factors that affect human health during ageing. Postmenopausal women are susceptible to bone fractures and reductions in bone mineral density because of oestrogen reduction but also air pollution. Further action is needed to reduce air pollution from diesel vehicles and wider fossil fuel use to protect public health. These may result in enormous reductions in hospitalisation, costs, and even mortality.”The US researchers found the lumbar spine was most susceptible to air pollution-induced bone loss and especially from nitrogen oxides.",

His headline speech to the Tory party conference spoke about the sense of responsibility that his party feels for the environment.But simultaneously he is arguing that his policies will end a (make-believe) war on motorists.And while cancelling the Manchester HS2 branch and building roads may feel like a lovely thing to do for a small group of drivers, it will potentially lead to all sorts of environmental problems elsewhere.Cancelling high-speed rail to build more roads is not just a betrayal of the promise to “level up” the north, but also a weakening by stealth of net zero policies. Transport produced 24% of the UK’s total emissions in 2020, and remains the largest emitting sector in the UK. Encouraging more traffic will only increase these emissions, and will make the country more unpleasant and polluted to live in.For a start, we already know that building more roads means more traffic – study after study has shown the way in which traffic grows to meet the available space, and five years after any road is built, traffic volume has increased and congestion is as it was originally.We also know it means more air pollution and less land for green spaces and housing. Sunak’s “approach” means continuing to burn fossil fuels for longer and delaying the changes needed for our planet and future economy.He has promised that the UK will still meet its climate targets, all while refusing to say how it will be done.

It produced millions of camera images, which researchers analysed to see how human activity has affected 159 mammal species in 16 protected areas across tropical regions on three continents. The camera traps across 1,000 sites collected images over up to 10 years across tropical forests.Cameras were stationed in protected areas including Bwindi impenetrable national park in Africa, Yasuní national park in South America and Pasoh forest reserve in south-east Asia.Researchers found that some animals were particularly badly affected by habitat fragmentation caused by deforestation. Specialist species, which use specific habitats only, thrived when habitat fragmentation – that is, losing parts of habitat around, but not necessarily in, a protected area – is low.Generalists do better in more diverse habitats where they have a range of different types of food and shelter. “Habitats are more varied at the edge of a protected area,” Semper-Pascual explained.The edge of the habitat changes from a dense tropical forest to open agricultural land, and this can give a more diverse habitat than in the depths of the forest. The flipside of this is that animals attracted to the edge of the habitat, near humans, are more vulnerable to being hunted either to protect farm animals or for products such as meat or fur.",

They will argue in the grand chamber of the Strasbourg court that the nations’ policies to tackle global heating are inadequate and in breach of their human rights obligations.In its defence to the legal action, which is the biggest climate case yet taken across the globe, the UK government argues it is taking world-beating action to tackle climate change, with a legally binding target to reach net zero by 2050.In documents submitted to the court, Kate Hughes, the director of international climate change at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, raises in evidence the government’s 10-point plan for a green industrial revolution, as proof of the tough policies being taken by the UK. The plan, she said, “has set out some of the concrete steps we will take to reach net zero emissions by 2050”.But key policies in the plan, which was introduced by the former prime minister Boris Johnson, have now been scrapped by Sunak. These include the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and the policy to phase out the installation of gas boilers by 2035.Lawyers representing the six young people taking the legal action are to present evidence that the current policies of the 32 countries mean the world is on track to reach 3C of global heating within their lifetimes and argue that the governments’ failure to act quickly enough to reduce emissions breaches the human rights of their clients.The case will be heard on Wednesday at a full-day hearing in front of 17 judges when the removal of what is a key defence in the UK government’s case could become significant.Gerry Liston, legal officer at Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), which is supporting the claimants, said: “The UK’s emissions targets are already inadequate.",

They were the longest sentences yet passed on non-violent protesters in the UK.Noting Decker and Trowland’s rights to peaceful protest, Fry asked the UK government to explain “why, in light of the current climate crisis, it was necessary to introduce and pass the Public Order Act and how both the Public Order Act and the sentencing of Mr Decker and Mr Trowland are compatible with international norms and standards”, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.He demanded ministers indicate “what steps have been taken … to ensure that non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations and all human rights defenders can carry out their peaceful work free from threat, violence, harassment or retaliation or any sort”.The UK government has not replied to Fry’s letter, which was sent on 15 August.",

They are calling on retailers to switch to slower-growing breeds and provide more space for the birds.An analysis of official figures in a new report by the animal welfare campaign group Open Cages found 82.3 million chickens died before reaching kill weight last year, a mortality rate of nearly 7%. It compares with 64 million chickens that died prematurely in 2021.More than 1.1 billion chickens are slaughtered for meat each year. The UK’s Red Tractor farm assurance scheme requires mortality rates not to exceed 5%.The British Poultry Council said that avian flu and extreme summer temperatures had contributed to mortality rates last year. It said the industry worked hard to ensure welfare for all birds.Connor Jackson, head of Open Cages, said a move to slower-growing breeds could significantly reduce mortality rates. Fast-growing breeds, which campaigners call “Frankenchickens”, grow so quickly that their hearts and bone structure can struggle to cope.The British Poultry Council says there isn’t consumer demand for a widespread adoption of slow-growing breeds, which would significantly increase the price of chicken meat in supermarketsHe said: “These figures highlight the shocking scale of suffering and death at the heart of the UK’s chicken industry. Just like eggs from caged hens, Frankenchickens must go if we want to live up to our ambitions of leading animal welfare standards.”The RSPCA said the figures highlighted the poor welfare standards in modern chicken production. A spokesperson said: “While the avian influenza outbreak will likely have impacted mortality rates in broilers, it is clear that such poor welfare standards and the use of fast-growing breeds will be contributing to the high mortality rate.”An initiative supported by animal welfare organisations, now called the Better Chicken Commitment, was launched in early 2017 to improve poultry welfare in broiler production. It stipulates more space for the birds and the use of slower-growing breeds.",

Fifty per cent “is a very troubling sort of threshold that we’ve crossed”, said Juan Declet-Barreto, a senior social scientist for climate vulnerability at UCS. “And we are one month and a half into danger season.”In recent days, storms battering the Lower Mississippi Valley and central Gulf coast states have downed power lines and mangled homes. In Texas, triple-digit temperatures are straining the power grid. The heat index has surpassed 120F in parts of the state, due to an unusually intense high pressure system.About 10% of the extreme heat alerts this year have a clear “climate signal” linking them to the climate crisis, said Declet-Barreto. That figure is based on the non-profit Climate Central’s Climate Shift Index, which estimates the influence of climate change on extreme temperatures around the world. In Texas, the heat was made at least three, four and five times as likely by climate change, the Index indicates.Overall, numerous studies have found that the climate crisis is fueling more intense and prolonged heatwaves, storms, droughts and floods.View image in fullscreenWorkers salvage personal belongings after tornado damage in Moss Point, Mississippi, on 20 June.

Lost, discarded or abandoned FADs can also cause environmental damage.The EU should lead by supporting tough action to curb use of the tools, as a meeting with regulators, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), starts in Mombasa this week, the groups say.Yellow fin tuna packed for market in Tenerife, Spain. The species has been overfished in the Indian Ocean since 2015. Photograph: Phil Crean A/AlamyYellowfin tuna, one of the fastest and strongest marine predators, have been overfished in the Indian Ocean since 2015. The region’s bigeye tuna stock was also recently assessed as overfished.Sainsbury’s and German chain Edeka, have previously joined Marks & Spencer in calling for states to monitor, manage and restrict FADs, to reduce overfishing and rebuild yellowfin stocks.Up to 300 free-floating FADs, typically consisting of a raft and submerged material where fish gather, can be used by a single vessel. Thousands are lost or abandoned every year. A rise in FAD use by industrial vessels has led to increased scrutiny of their impact on marine ecosystems. Many retailers, including Sainsbury’s and M&S, sell own-brand “FAD-free” tuna.The 33 parties to the IOTC are gathering from 3-5 February to discuss proposals to monitor, manage and restrict FAD use. India has submitted a proposal to ban FADs used by purse seine vessels. A proposal by the EU suggests using biodegradable material in FADs to mitigate environmental harm, as well as increasing traceability and accountability and restricting FAD use per vessel to 280 by 2024 and 260 by 2026.",

In July and August they give birth, producing up to 11 young encased in transparent membranes, which split open immediately.Blackish at first, the juveniles turn bronze-brown and then develop a beaded pattern of spots and stripes. Colours vary through yellow, browns and greens, with some remaining wholly black. While no individual is the same, females tend to be stripier and males spottier.This specimen has an olive back with darker stripes, but I cannot be sure of its sex without seeing its underside.

There are some living free in parts of the UK, including Devon, and there is a large population in Scotland – there largely as a result of escapes from private collections and illegal releases.Beavers have been also released under licence in Scotland to bolster wild local beaver populations, and last year Nature Scot, Scotland’s nature agency, published a plan for a widespread return of beaver to the country.It is unclear whether a future Labour government would legalise beaver releases into the wild.

With their dams, they create wetlands that are important for biodiversity – one study found that wild-living beavers have alleviated flooding, reduced pollution and boosted fish populations. Beavers are loved by wildlife campaigners who call them “nature’s gardeners”.“I was disappointed when I heard Thérèse Coffey say what she said recently in relation to her lack of priorities to rewilding.

Ozone levels over the Antarctic are expected to bounce back to 1980 levels by 2066.The ozone hole is usually smaller during El Niño years, but modelling by Jucker and collaborators, including Chris Lucas of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, has suggested it will be larger than usual in 2023, due to long-lasting atmospheric changes after the undersea Tonga volcano explosion in January last year. The modelling has not yet been peer-reviewed.Lucas, a senior research scientist at the BoM, said early indications showed the Antarctic ozone hole was beginning to form.“As of 4 August, the NASA ozone hole webpage suggests the formation is currently about ‘average’ for the day of the year,” he said. “Some forecasts expect this to increase rapidly, in the next few days, producing one of the largest (for the time of year) observed ozone holes.”“The most rapid growth of the ozone hole occurred in the year 2000.

Many governments in Africa lack the capabilities to record climate impacts. The scientists behind the report said this lack of information made implementing measures to avoid deaths very difficult.The study linking the prolonged heatwave to the climate crisis was the first in sub-Saharan Africa and found temperatures were 2.5C higher than the recent average. Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar and home to more than 3 million people, suffered some of the most unusual heat. If continued fossil-fuel burning pushes global temperature up to 2C above pre-industrial levels, this intensity of heatwave would be expected every five years, the researchers calculated.Hundreds of climate studies have now shown that human-caused global heating is making extreme weather more frequent and more intense across the world. Heatwaves alone are likely to have caused millions of unreported early deaths over the last three decades.Funding from wealthy countries to help the developing world cope with climate impacts will be a key topic at the UN Cop28 climate summit that begins on 30 November.Dr Rondrotiana Barimalala, an oceanographer from Madagascar now at the Norwegian Research Centre in Bergen, said: “Madagascar is already being impacted by climate change, making life harder for millions of people.

It was believed he had Sunak’s support, and the government claimed removing these rules for housebuilders could unlock more than 100,000 homes.The nutrient neutrality scheme, aimed at saving England’s rivers from being overloaded with nitrates and phosphates, which cause algal blooms and choke oxygen from rivers, allows developers to pay for “credits” to improve local wetland areas. This allows them to offset pollution caused by new homes that would overwhelm sewage systems in sensitive areas. The proposed new law would have allowed planning officials to ignore the extra pollution caused by sewage from new homes in sensitive areas and runoff from construction sites, with the taxpayer paying for the offsets instead.Previously the government had planned to put the bill, aimed at boosting housebuilding by taking away costs from developers, into the King’s speech. This is no longer planned to be the case.Gove told an event at the Conservative party conference earlier this month that he planned to bring a bill to scrap nutrient neutrality to the House of Commons “as soon as possible provided the prime minister lets me”.Sunak appears to have performed a U-turn, as government sources said ministers would now find alternatives to primary legislation to unblock homes currently in breach of nutrient neutrality rules.Ministers previously tried to dismantle the rules via an amendment to the levelling up bill. Because it was a last-minute addition, it did not go to the Commons and instead was voted on by the Lords.The peers delivered an astonishing defeat to the government when they voted against the amendment, which would have forced local authorities to turn a blind eye to pollution from new developments.",

Local residents described it as a “sinkhole”, but a HS2 spokesperson said what had emerged from the ground was a slurry pool.The spokesperson said that tunnelling work has resumed at the site after it was halted on Saturday. It is understood that Environment Agency officials came to the scene and are monitoring the situation.The incident began when a brown, bubbling substance emerged from the ground. HS2 said the foam has now been cleared, but on Sunday afternoon lumps of white foam could be seen emerging from the grass on the playing field, which is owned by Hillingdon council and leased to Ruislip Rugby Club.SCS, a Skanska Costain Strabag joint venture, is constructing 13 miles of twin-bore tunnels on the HS2 route to its southern terminus at Euston. The West Ruislip tunnel is being created using a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM).When the contractors saw what was happening, they sealed off the area and started extra ground monitoring with the aim of preventing subsidence resulting from the leak. Additional ground anchors are being installed to protect against subsidence.The contractors believe the leak was the result of an existing borehole, which caused slurry to travel up the borehole and pool on the surface. They will continue to monitor the area over the next few days.The chair of the rugby club, Jatin Radia, said: “Local residents have been up in arms about the HS2 project.

This means contaminated air can pose a threat to how successfully fruit flies and other insects reproduce, and could lead to population decline.“Everyone knows that we are facing insect decline, and so far the reason was pesticide use and habitat loss. But we think that we should also consider oxygen pollutants,” said Markus Knaden, a researcher of evolutionary neuroethology at the Max Planck Institute and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications.This study builds on research into how insects perceive flower odours differently when exposed to elevated levels of ozone. Knaden’s team tested nine different species of Drosophila fruit flies by exposing half the males from each species to ambient air, and half to an atmosphere with ozone levels at 100 parts per billion. Average industrial ozone levels are at roughly 40 parts per billion, but regions like India, China or Mexico experience magnitudes as high as 210 parts per billion.The scientists found the males exposed to higher ozone levels started emitting fewer pheromones. As a result, they had trouble attracting female partners. “When we expose male flies to ozone, then suddenly it took them much longer to convince the female to mate,” said Knaden.What’s more, emitting pheromones also helps males fend off other males from trying to reproduce with them. But being exposed to ozone led to males smelling less like males, and a rise in the number of attempts to mate between males, Knaden said.“In the lab, it doesn’t matter whether the male has to wait one or two minutes longer to mate, or whether the male accidentally courts another male,” says Knaden. “But in the field there is a lot of selection pressure and the flies have to be efficient, so they have to give everything to find the female as soon as possible, copulate and fertilise her eggs before they’re killed by a predator.",

One that is designed – from the start – with respect for the challenges of the countryside.”The Labour party has announced new policies on crime in recent days, with the shadow justice secretary, Steve Reed, pledging “clean up squads” for fly-tippers.The NFU has lobbied for years against trade deals that could undercut British farmers, such as the one the former prime minister Liz Truss struck with Australia, amid fears that post-Brexit Britain would be too reliant on imports.Thérèse Coffey this week told the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture winter conference in Washington DC, that she hoped to increase trade with the US and import more of its “fantastic produce”.However, Starmer will tell the conference that under a Labour government, British farmers will be prioritised and standards upheld.He will say: “It was obvious the Conservative party had given up on farmers when they elected Liz Truss. Labour’s approach to trade will be very different – I can promise you that. We want to remove barriers to exporters, not put them up. We want to protect high British standards, not water them down.“We are going to talk to our friends in the European Union, and we are going to seek a better trading relationship for British farming.",

To fail to act, rather than merely speak out, is to tolerate a status quo that cannot be sustained. I am therefore resigning my party whip and instead intend to be free from any party-political allegiance.”Skidmore was the energy minister who signed into law the former prime minister Theresa May’s net zero by 2050 pledge. More recently he led the government’s net zero review, which was published in September 2022. He has been critical of this government before, and previously told the Guardian the Conservative party was heading in a “very dark direction” around misinformation and climate change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is banned from lobbying the government or using his contacts in Whitehall on behalf of Augean until September 2024.Eustice declined to answer questions on how much he would be paid for his role and what experience he would rely on in his work for Augean. He said if a financial interest did arise it would be declared through the parliamentary register.In Acoba’s advice letter, neither Eustice nor the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs made any mention of the investigation by the EA, an arms-length body of Defra.The investigation resulted in Augean South, a subsidiary of Augean, paying £25,000 to an environmental charity in Northamptonshire, where the company’s site is located, as well as £11,058.90 to cover the costs of the EA inquiry.The groundwater contamination was discovered during routine inspections by Augean in March 2020, with the agency finding the company had “negligently exceed its environmental permits”.The EA investigated a discharge in 2020 that had a “short-term impact on wildlife and saw some amphibian species decline but populations recovered by the following summer”.The agency said “vegetation also naturally improved after the pollution”, and it was satisfied that Augean had taken appropriate action to resolve the situation.Eustice told Acoba that a meeting, held in April 2023, with one of the partners of a private equity firm that is a shareholder in Augean had led to the job offer being made.Augean said neither it nor the private equity firm had any contact with Eustice before the conclusion of the agency’s undertaking.",

You’re getting a storage bin for inside, why not for outside? You get a sofa, you can buy an outdoor bench, that sort of thing.”The Renters’ Retreat garden.

If you’re going to give your tenants cutlery you should give them garden tools.”The garden designer, who quit her job as a civil servant during the pandemic to work in horticulture, said her garden, called Renters’ Retreat, was inspired by her own experience of renting and feeling unable to plant flowers.",

Located on Neville Island in the Ohio River, near Pittsburgh in the US, the site had been used to produce coal-coke for steelmaking for about 100 years. Closure of the plant resulted in an immediate reduction in air pollution for the local communities. Sulphur dioxide decreased by 90%, arsenic by 66% and particle pollution also improved.There was an immediate 42% decrease in emergency room visits for heart problems and further declines in the three years that followed, until the end of study, showing that the closure led to long-term health improvements. A similar pattern was seen in stroke cases. These changes were not seen in two communities away from the plant that were used as experimental controls.When looking at medical statistics it is possible to overlook the real-world experience of the people affected. Testimony from the local community reveals what it was like to live with the air pollution, dust and odour from the plant. Some people explained how they struggled to manage their asthma and others said their breathing problems got worse when they first moved into the area. It was routine to close windows at night as pollution settled over the community.Air pollution is often invisible in our everyday lives. Reminiscent of the Covid lockdowns, the plant closure brought immediate changes, with people suddenly noticing crystal-blue skies, instead of haze, and the smells of nature along with improvements to their health.Prof George Thurston, of New York University Grossman School of Medicine, who led the study said: “We found much larger cardiac health benefits from the plant’s closure than expected. This provides solid confirmation that fossil fuel-related air pollution is far more toxic than other types of air pollution. Policymakers have been greatly underestimating the local and immediate human health benefits that will occur as we phase out fossil fuel processing and combustion in our cities and towns.",

This month, for the third year in a row, ministers agreed to set at least half of the catch limits for shared stocks above scientific advice. This means a green light for overfishing, according to the Blue Marine Foundation.The deal for 2024, agreed by the UK, the EU and Norway, will result in 750,000 tonnes of fishing opportunities, worth £970m for the UK fleet.Mark Spencer, the fisheries minister, said scientific advice had informed deals setting 70 catch limits for fish stocks in the North Sea and north-east Atlantic, in support of a “sustainable” and profitable fishing sector. But conservation and environmental law NGOs have criticised ministers from all the nations involved, warning many severely depleted fish populations remain at “grave risk”.Charles Clover, co-founder of Blue Marine, said: “How long is the British public, the fishing industry or the Treasury meant to tolerate Defra ministers routinely, blithely and disingenuously breaking their own post-Brexit laws? Who is going to challenge them? Someone should and we are prepared to do so in the national interest.”Blue Marine has written to ministers saying it will be seeking leave for judicial review of its determination of fishing opportunities for 2024, if these are in line with the government announcement on 8 December 2023.When the government introduced the Fisheries Act, the first domestic fisheries legislation in four decades, it said it would create a “world class” management regime drawing on “best available science” to ensure fish populations are healthy and sustainable.The reality is different, say conservationists.",

There are physical assets, like substations, which transmission companies will need to build or upgrade.”The government is belatedly attempting to tackle a logjam that has resulted in some developments facing a 10- to 15-year wait for a connection to the grid. Ofgem announced on Monday plans to remove “zombie” projects from the queue to connect up to speed up those ready to produce renewable power for the grid.Although no equivalent queue exists for those looking to take power from the grid, ministers and officials are concerned that large projects could struggle to secure final investment and proceed without guarantees over their connection to the electricity supply.Sources said changes to the rules had been proposed with several big projects in mind: Tata’s new £4bn electric battery factory, expected to be built in Somerset; and the switch to electric arc furnaces at Britain’s biggest steelworks at Port Talbot in south Wales, also owned by the Indian group.The £1.25bn plan from British Steel, which is owned by China’s Jingye, to replace two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe steelworks, with an electric arc furnace at the north Lincolnshire plant and another at a site in Teesside, North Yorkshire, has also formed part of the proposals.",

Both companies will instead rely on much cleaner electric arc furnaces, which use 87 times less coal.West Cumbria Mining plans to produce 2.8m tonnes of coking coal a year at Woodhouse colliery in Whitehaven for use by “steelmakers in the UK and EU”. However, the blast furnace closures would mean a dramatic reduction in coal use by the UK industry, and would probably mean that the vast majority of the Cumbrian coal would have to be exported.Tim Farron, the MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale in Cumbria and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the announcement from British Steel “means that any economic case for a new coalmine in Cumbria is now completely dead in the water”.He said: “We need to see the government wake up to the fact that the steel industry is now going full steam ahead to decarbonise steel and start to invest in long-term renewable jobs for the future.”The former Woodhouse colliery site where West Cumbria Mining have been given approval to once again extract coal. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesMichael Gove, the government minister in charge of planning, approved the UK’s first new coalmine in 30 years last December, despite criticism from former Conservative ministers including Alok Sharma and Lord Deben.Electric arc furnaces require only 9kg of coking coal a tonne of steel against 780kg for a tonne of blast furnace steel, according to the lobby group UK Steel.British blast furnaces produced 4.8m tonnes of steel in 2022, suggesting they may have used 3.7m tonnes of coking coal. Based on UK Steel’s figures, producing the same amount of steel in electric arc furnaces would require only 43,000 tonnes of coal, or about 1.7% of the Cumbrian mine’s output.",

But … over a sustained period of time if it means you’ve missed most of your training over a year or two, then it starts to weigh individually and collectively.”Dr Andrew Dowse, director of the security analyst Rand Australia, warned that “concurrent national crises” of both disasters and military threats meant alternatives were needed.Dr Alex Bristow, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s director of strategic policy, called for the states and territories to take on more responsibilities as Australia faced the most dangerous strategic environment since the second world war.The inquiry chair, Labor MP Julian Hill, said defence had been increasingly used as part of the national response to domestic crises, and the inquiry was looking at how that impacted their preparation, training and capability.In its submission, defence pointed out that while the states and territories have responsibility for domestic disasters, if their resources are overwhelmed, the federal government could also direct defence to assist.",

The previous reading, taken two years ago, recorded the summit at 4,807.81 metres, which was in turn almost a metre less than the measurement taken in 2017.Describing 2023 as a “somewhat exceptional year”, one of the surveyors involved, Denis Borel, told the French televisions channel TF1 that the mountain had lost “3,500 cubic metres of ice and snow compared to the volume measured in 2021, representing roughly the volume of an Olympic swimming pool”. Borel said the loss was “quite considerable compared to the measurements of previous eras”.Climate and glaciology experts cautioned against linking the shrinking of Mont Blanc’s summit to the loss of glacial ice cover in the Alps.“Even if we see that there is a slight downward trend – around 15 to 20cm since 2001 – of this snowy summit of Mont Blanc, climatologists and glaciologists tell us that it takes approximately 50 years of measurement to be able to draw conclusions on possible global warming at this altitude of 4,800 metres,” said Borrel. Ice cover at the summit of Europe tended to experience variation, depending on wind and precipitation, he said.“This is not representative of global climate warming, because the climatic conditions at the summit of Mont Blanc are rather polar,” said Luc Moreau, a glaciologist from Chamonix.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ice extent is expected to shrink even further before this year’s summer melting season ends.The impact of the climate crisis in melting sea ice in the Arctic is clear in the records that stretch back to 1979. Antarctic sea ice varies much more from year to year, which has made it harder to see an effect from global heating.However, “remarkable” losses of Antarctic sea ice in the last six years indicate that the record levels of heat now in the ocean and related changes in weather patterns may mean that the climate crisis is finally manifesting in the observations.Scientists were already very concerned about Antarctic ice.

The full impact of the virus’s arrival is not yet known, but scientists are raising concerns about possible “catastrophic breeding failure” of the region’s fragile wildlife populations.The virus was found in populations of a scavenging bird called brown skua on Bird Island, which is part of the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. These migratory birds probably brought it with them from South America where bird flu is widespread and has already killed an estimated 500,000 seabirds and 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru alone.The current outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1 – which started in 2021 – is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds. Researchers have long been concerned about its potential impact on Antarctic wildlife, because many species are found nowhere else in the world, and are not known to have been exposed to bird flu viruses before.Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) took swabs of the birds when they found unexplained mortality and sent them for testing in the UK.Ashley Bennison, the BAS science manager for Bird Island, said: “This is a particularly sad event to confirm.

Their findings and recommendations will be published over the coming months.UN head accuses fossil fuel firms of business models ‘inconsistent with human survival’Read more“Planetary stability is not possible without a justice approach,” said Joyeeta Gupta, a professor of environment and development at the University of Amsterdam, who is one of the lead authors. “It took a long time to persuade the nature scientists.”She said the concept of justice needed to be applied between generations and species, as well as within the current human population. It should minimise harm and define minimum levels of access to food, water, energy and infrastructure.Her co-chair of the study, Johan Rockström, said the inclusion of social science was the next step in his work to define a safe operating space for humanity. Previously, he led teams that defined a range of planetary boundaries, including for climate, land system change, freshwater use, chemical pollution, ocean acidification and biodiversity. With the new study, he is collaborating with social scientists to map where just boundaries are different from safe boundaries.The initial papers are expected to launch a debate about the fairest as well as the safest way to use the planet’s remaining space for development.",

The agriculture ministry has now banned the use of water for irrigation, watering green spaces and other public areas, and for washing cars.“I’ve been experiencing water cuts overnight for the last two or three weeks,” said Haythem Hazel, an English teacher in the capital, Tunis. “It’s alarming. It shows we really have a water crisis in Tunisia. It’s difficult to stay without water for even two hours.”.Reservoirs across the country are said to be about 30% short of capacity. Levels at the Sidi Salem reservoir, which serves the north of the country, including Tunis, are only about 16% full.Tunisia has always relied heavily on capturing surface water for its supplies, leaving it especially vulnerable to shortages of rainfall driven by the climate crisis. In the past four years, the Mediterranean region has had blistering summers, mild winters and relatively little rain.It is estimated that temperatures across Tunisia will increase by up to 3.8C (6.8F) by 2050, while rainfall will decrease by at least 4% over the same period.A network of ageing pipes is making the problem worse. According to project workers from the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) in Tunis, leaks account for the loss of about 30% of the country’s water before it reaches a tap.“Much of the infrastructure is very old, dating back to the 1950s,” said Imen Rais, WWF’s freshwater programme manager, “and it hasn’t really been maintained since the [2011] revolution.”Poor enforcement of planning regulations since the revolution has also affected both availability of water and quality. Unsanctioned housing and lack of infrastructure in poorer districts has led to the siphoning of groundwater through illegally dug wells and wastewater flowing directly into the water supply.“This is as bad as we’ve seen,” said Jamel Jrijer, director for WWF North Africa. “This was predicted as far back as the 1970s but we’ve never really seen any action. Matters deteriorated after the revolution, where successive governments promised everything but did nothing.",

The cycle to work scheme has the potential to open up equitable access to cycling and provide a cost-effective solution for many workers within this group. The scheme is a proven mechanism at getting more people cycling, and we believe those on the lowest incomes should benefit too.”People who are self-employed represented more than 13% of the UK labour market, the letter added, a proportion that was expected to grow, and were also unfairly excluded, it added.Data collected by the Cycle to Work Alliance, made up of the five biggest bike providers under the scheme, including Halfords and Evans Cycles, shows it has become more in demand because of changing travel patterns during the Covid crisis, especially for key workers.",

Although climate litigation has spread quickly around the world, these are the first such cases to be heard by the ECHR.In the first lawsuit, a group of Swiss women over the age of 64 known as the KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz (Senior Women for Climate Protection Switzerland) argued they were particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis because heatwaves, which are becoming more frequent and intense, put their health at risk.Supported by Greenpeace Switzerland, they want the court to order Switzerland to set tougher emission reductions targets and to do everything in its power to do its fair share to keep the global temperature rise to below 1.5C.A contingent from the KlimaSeniorinnen travelled to Strasbourg to hear their arguments being made in front of the court’s grand chamber, which is reserved for the most serious and novel cases. Elisabeth Stern, 74, who is on the organisation’s board, said it felt like “a historic moment”.During the hearing, the KlimaSeniorinnen’s legal team presented evidence that older adults suffer worse than others during periods of extreme heat and are more likely to die. Older women are even more vulnerable.The British barrister Jessica Simor KC, who is representing the women, told the court her clients were already experiencing the effects of climate change, which posed “extremely serious threats not just to their health and wellbeing but to their very existence”.She claimed that this breached articles two and eight of the European convention on human rights, which protect the right to life and to respect for private and family life.Marc Willers KC, another British barrister representing the women, argued that the Swiss government’s progress in meeting its existing climate targets was “woefully inadequate”.He said these goals were in any case too weak for Switzerland to do its fair share to stay within 1.5C.",

A second borehole returns the warm water to the surface where it can be used to heat homes and businesses or generate electricity.Kieran Mullan MP, who was tasked with producing the report, said the “strong overlap” between areas in need of investment and the best geothermal locations was unexpected, but it could provide another reason for the government to look again at supporting the renewable energy technology.“Unlike wind or solar this technology provides baseload – it is there constantly. And our expertise in drilling in the North Sea means we are well placed to motor ahead,” Mullan said.The UK’s early steps into geothermal energy include a project in Seaham, County Durham, which will use water from mineshafts to heat 1,500 new homes and a scheme at the Eden project in Cornwall which generates heat to warm Eden’s rainforest and Mediterranean biomes as well as offices, kitchens and greenhouses.prime English sites for geothermal energyIn theory, the UK has enough geothermal energy trapped underground to heat every home for a hundred years.",

With careful management he believed the island could navigate the next two months, after which rain was expected.“We are not complacent. We are trying to solve the situation.

It’s really affected the business,” she said.Ratchaporn Poolsawadee, the president of the Tourism Association of Koh Samui, said that rather than benefiting from a resurgence in tourist arrivals this year, businesses were instead having to use their profits to buy water.

The shocking photographs and video footage of wildfires in Hawaii and Greece, and floods in China, along with the terrible loss of life and testimony from those who fled, are beginning to bring home the contribution of global heating to such disasters – even if people, and especially businesses and governments, may be slow to accept the truth and even slower to act on it.Yet our eyes cannot fully capture the devastation in Hawaii, and it does not end where its shores meet the sea. Beneath the surface of the water, sediment runoff may smother coral polyps and block sunlight, affecting the growth of colonies, experts warn. This is only one element of a broader disaster now unfolding, which scientists fear may soon be global and yet which has generated relatively little attention or alarm. Corals in countries across Central America, North America and the Caribbean are suffering significant bleaching as they experience unprecedented levels of heat stress due to record ocean temperatures, and there are similar warnings about reefs off northern Vietnam and southern China. In Florida, some sites have reported total loss of all corals.Coral reefs account for only 0.1% of the surface area of the ocean. Yet they support a quarter of the world’s known marine life – and an estimated half a billion people, for whom they provide food, jobs and coastal defences. Most corals grow less than an inch a year; some deep sea colonies have been developing for more than 4,000 years. But destruction happens at a terrifying pace. Reef cover has halved since the 1950s, with the rate of loss accelerating. And while bleaching does not always lead to the death of corals, scientists say they don’t reproduce as well and are more susceptible to disease – or further bleaching. As temperature extremes become more frequent, reefs have less time to recover. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that 1.5C of global warming – the level the world is predicted to reach early next decade – would lead to the destruction of between 70% and 90% of the world’s reefs.",

These are mounted on garden fences and on the sides of houses across the Lancashire town.

This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels.“In very simple, but very striking terms, five years ago global energy investment was $2tn, of which $1tn was for clean energy and $1tn was for fossil fuels. Today, $1tn is for fossil fuels and $1.7tn is for clean energy. This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it’s very exciting.”The clean energy boom is particularly apparent in solar power investment, Birol said. “For the first time in history the amount of investment going to solar is higher than the amount going to oil production. It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning,” he said.Clean energy investment has climbed steadily in recent years as governments and investors have sought to take advantage of the low cost of renewables such as wind and solar power.In contrast, investment in fossil fuels plunged during the Covid-19 pandemic when severe travel restrictions caused demand for transport fuels to plummet, leading to a collapse in energy commodity prices.",

The main driver of rising plastic consumption in sub-Saharan Africa, where 70% of the population is under 30, is demand for vehicles and other products amid rising income and population growth.Overall, plastic use worldwide is projected to almost triple by 2060.The soaring demand for plastic predicted across sub-Saharan Africa, where many countries do not have the capacity to manage it, was revealed before a meeting of governments in Nairobi, Kenya, next week to hammer out a UN treaty to fight plastic pollution.Rich Gower, senior economist at Tearfund, said: “The signs of environmental breakdown are all around us, but this treaty has the potential to curb the plastics crisis and improve the lives of billions of people.“Much of the plastic being used in sub-Saharan Africa is plastic packaging and ends up being dumped and burned,” he added. He urged negotiators in Nairobi to agree to significant reductions in plastic production and to put waste pickers, who collect 60% of all plastic that gets recycled globally, front and centre of the treaty.In the absence of global rules and regulations, people living in developing countries and the waste pickers who collect the waste, disproportionately bear the brunt of the environmental and health impacts of plastic pollution.Dr Tiwonge Mzumara-Gawa, from Malawi, a waste campaigner who will be at the negotiations in Kenya, said: “While these negotiations continue, the health of people in Malawi and across Africa is being impacted by plastic pollution every day.John Chweya, chairman of the waste pickers’ association of Kenya, pushes a handcart through Kisumu.

        "text": "UK households could face higher energy bills next year, after a leading forecaster said electricity market prices will rise in 2024 – and remain well above pre-energy crisis levels for the rest of the decade.Analysts at Cornwall Insight predicted that Britain’s wholesale power prices would rise from an average of £96.64 per megawatt-hour so far this year to £129/MWh next year, due to higher gas prices triggered by the war in Ukraine.The analysis was undertaken based on the commodity futures markets at the end of September. Since then, gas and electricity markets have climbed further due to fears that the Israel-Hamas war could pose a risk to oil and gas supplies.Electricity prices were also forecast to stay elevated until the end of the decade, remaining at least 60% higher than they were in 2021 before the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic caused markets to climb.The analysts expect that as more renewable energy connects to the grid, reducing reliance on gas-fired power plants, market prices will begin to fall. However, they will stay above £80/MWh – well above pre-crisis levels.Tom Edwards, a senior modeller at Cornwall Insight, said slowing the UK’s shift towards renewable energy could keep energy bills higher for longer. Cornwall’s latest report found the UK was likely to miss its target to increase offshore wind fivefold to 50GW by 2030 due to rising costs in the supply chain.“Rolling back our net zero ambitions and slowing our transition away from fossil fuels is likely to be a costly delay that will not only see us fall further behind in decarbonising the country but will leave consumers shouldering the prolonged burden of high prices,” Edwards said.“Without a resolute commitment to a greener and more sustainable future, achieving net zero emissions and pre-crisis energy bills becomes an increasingly elusive goal,” he added.Cornwall forecasts that by 2030 offshore wind will make up 26% of the UK’s installed electricity capacity, up from about 13% today. Meanwhile, the share of gas power plants will fall from 27% of the UK’s total power capacity to 13% by 2030.",

Scientists have said the extreme oceanic heat is consistent with the expected impacts of the climate crisis.The exceptional warmth of the Gulf extends down to about 165ft below the surface of the area where Idalia is traveling through, a rare occurrence described as “other-worldly” by Andy Hazelton, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).This level of ocean heat alone would be enough to make Idalia a devastating category 5 storm, scientists have said, although other factors such as wind shear will influence the ultimate outcome of the tempest. Hurricanes gather strength from warm oceans and moisture in the atmosphere, which are both facets of global heating.Studies have shown there is evidence that Atlantic hurricanes are becoming stronger and intensifying more rapidly due to these accelerants provided by the climate crisis. The current naturally occurring El Niño climate phenomenon, which has heated up the equatorial Pacific Ocean, is normally associated with a weaker hurricane season in the Atlantic, but Noaa recently warned of an above-average period of storms due, in part, to the extreme heat that has accumulated in the oceans.",

This equates to an average of 64 sewage dumps a day, or a new sewage dump taking place every 22 minutes.The sewage scandal has become a hot topic at the local elections, and the government recently released a plan to tackle the issue of raw waste being dumped into waterways. However, the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, has said she believes the infrastructure needed to stop the spills is too expensive.She also wrote this week in the online magazine ConservativeHome that she believes Labour and the Liberal Democrats have been “scamming” the public by drawing attention to the issue.The shadow environment secretary, Jim McMahon, said: “The first duty of any member of parliament is to the people that send them to Westminster. That Tory cabinet ministers allow the areas that they represent to be sullied in tonnes of filthy raw sewage shows they have no respect for the places where their constituents live and work.“The next Labour government will build a better Britain, ending the Tory sewage scandal by delivering mandatory monitoring on all sewage outlets, introducing automatic fines for discharges, setting ambitious targets for stopping systematic sewage dumping and ensuring that water bosses are held to account for negligence.",

Because, as Christian Horemans, an environment and health expert with the Belgian mutual insurer Mutualités Libres, explains: “It has an enormous impact on public health and an enormous cost for the Belgian compulsory health and disability insurance. We consider it our duty to analyse risks for the financial sustainability of health and disability insurance, part of social security.”The insurer’s recent study , carried out by a team that included Belgian and Dutch universities and research centres, compared health insurance claims from 1.2 million people in Belgium in 2019 with particle pollution in their neighbourhoods. The financial results were startling.Europe’s politicians have moral responsibility to tackle air pollution, says WHO environment directorRead moreThe team focused on the costs of nearly 4m GP visits and more than half a million visits to hospital emergency departments made by young people and adults, aged 10 to 64. After removing the social and economic factors that affect people’s health, the study found associations between GP and hospital emergency visits and particle pollution (PM2.5), and when it applied the results to Belgium as a whole, researchers estimated that reducing air pollution to match the least polluted 25% of places in Belgium would have saved €43m (£37m) in GP and emergency hospital visits in 2019.It is likely that even greater savings would be achieved by meeting World Health Organization guidelines for air pollution, as proposed by the European parliament for 2035.Horemans said: “The lower the concentrations of PM2.5, the fewer people need to see the general practitioner. So improving air quality not only benefits public health, but also ensures the financial sustainability of the social security system.”The study also found that more tree and grass cover in a neighbourhood was associated with less demand for GP and hospital visits. This was especially true of cities and accords with wider evidence on green space in urban areas.The World Health Organization already recommends that we have access to 0.5 hectares (1.2 acres) of public green space, about two-thirds the size of a football pitch, within 300 metres of our homes.",

In May, National Grid had to ask some turbines in the west of Scotland to shut down, as the network was unable to store such a large amount of electricity when a then record 19.9GW of power was produced – enough to boil 3.5m kettles.The ESO said a new record was also set for the share of electricity on the grid coming from zero-carbon sources – renewables and nuclear – which supplied 87.2% of total power. These sources have accounted for about 55% to 59% of power over the past couple of years.The surge in wind generation represents a remarkable reversal in fortunes as a cold snap that enveloped Britain and Europe quickly turned to milder weather.Power prices had soared as the freezing weather forced Britons to increase their heating use, pushing up demand for energy despite high bills.The cold weather came with a period of low wind, reducing the production of Britain’s windfarms to close to zero.Emergency coal-fired power units at Drax in North Yorkshire were put on standby but ultimately not used, while gas-fired generation accounted for nearly 60% of the UK’s power output at times.However, milder weather in the UK and Europe in recent days has led to a reduction in demand from consumers and a fall in wholesale gas prices. It has also reduced the risk of power cuts this winter, which National Grid had warned could be a possibility.",

Only one of its sites was affected in 2022.“It is absolutely devastating for these birds,” said Ben McCarthy, the trust’s head of nature conservation and restoration ecology. “It is really tough for the rangers. It is upsetting to see so much death around you.He said that on the Farne Islands in Northumberland, “quite literally a herring gull fell out of the sky beside me”.“It is an extraordinary experience, really quite devastating, to see the scale of the mortality,” he said.McCarthy said avian flu had added to the extreme pressure seabirds were already under because of climate change.Government action on the disease was necessary, he said, but it had to be part of a bigger picture. “We do need the government to take bolder, stronger and more urgent action around the existential challenges of things like climate change and the nature crisis,” he said.“Very detailed and long-term monitoring” of avian flu needed to be coordinated by the government and its agencies, he said.The government had got off to a “bit of a slow start”, he said. “But we are now getting in sync with each other … My concern is that the effort is sustained.”ChartMcCarthy said the trust had released bleak, “very depressing” figures for its sites.At Long Nanny in Northumberland, home to Britain’s largest mainland colony of Arctic terns, James Porteus, an area ranger, said it was “absolutely heartbreaking” to see so many birds die.Rangers began seeing signs of the disease in late June and have collected 1,066 dead Arctic tern chicks (roughly 40% of the population) and 263 adults (at least 8%).“This year’s losses could take years to recover from,” he said. “And that’s before we consider how this indiscriminate disease might impact the colony once again next year.”At the Farne Islands there were fewer dead birds than last year (down 39%), which Harriet Reid, also an area ranger, said was partly down to regular pick-ups.",

After more than two decades of tortuous talks under the UN, the world finally had a global treaty compelling governments to act on the climate crisis.That it all came together, on a Saturday night in a former airfield on the outskirts of Paris, was a testament to the hard work put in by a small cadre of climate negotiators. While world leaders and politicians took the credit in front of the cameras, the bureaucrats trudged off to their hotels to get some sleep.Peter Betts, who has died of a brain tumour aged 64, was one of those key civil servants who helped draft the Paris agreement and shepherd it to safety. A veteran of the British climate team, he acted as chief negotiator for the EU – the main force behind the Paris agreement, for all that the US and China stole the headlines.A trim figure in short-sleeved white shirts, he was an old-fashioned civil servant, of the sort schooled in the need to speak truth to power, but to do so courteously, with impartial advice, while recognising that the elected politicians make the decisions. He spent 35 years in the civil service, retiring a few years after Paris, in 2018, though returning briefly to an advisory role on the UK’s hosting of Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021.Betts was born in Battersea, south-west London, to George, a member of the Salvage Corps, part of the Fire Brigade, and Joyce (nee Pedder), a welfare worker.He attended Emanuel grammar school and then went to Mansfield College, Oxford, to study history.After graduating in 1982, he worked through a series of odd jobs – including a brief stint on the East End News (1982-83) – before moving into the civil service in 1984.

And this is something that Daniel Goldhaber’s propulsive eco-thriller How to Blow Up a Pipeline smartly acknowledges. Even on the eve of a radical act of violent protest – the destruction of two sections of Texas’s oil infrastructure – some of the environmental activists behind the plan are reluctant to use the term. Rowan (Kristine Froseth), a 22-year-old from Portland, Oregon, prefers to think of herself as a “revolutionary” or “gamechanger”. Other members draw parallels with the Boston Tea Party or the civil rights movement. But Theo (Sasha Lane), a young woman from a poisoned suburb of Long Beach, California, is under no illusions. “They’re gonna call us terrorists. Because we are doing terrorism.” Her terminal cancer diagnosis, the consequence of a childhood growing up in the shadow of an oil refinery, means that Theo is done with tiptoeing around the truth, however unpleasant it might be.Ultimately, these are ordinary people impelled to act by the extraordinary circumstancesThis debate, lubricated by liquor and loosened by night-before nerves, is a pivotal moment that comes some 30 minutes into the film. It’s a scene that concedes that yes, these characters are extremists whose actions will have potentially devastating consequences. But it also takes an empathic view, making the case that, ultimately, these are ordinary people impelled to act by the extraordinary circumstances in which they find themselves. It’s morally complex territory – the knotty ethical issues that underpin the tautly executed action have some parallels with those of Paradise Now, Hany Abu-Assad’s largely sympathetic portrait of a pair of Palestinian suicide bombers. It’s worth noting, however, that Pipeline’s protagonists are scrupulous about targeting infrastructure rather than people. “We’re not murderers,” stresses Rowan, when her feckless pot-head boyfriend, Logan (Lukas Gage), suggests that anyone who works for an oil company is fair game.It’s an impressively assured second picture from Goldhaber, whose debut film, Cam, achieved minor success on the festival circuit – a gripping piece of film-making, which deftly weaves the characters’ backstories into a tense account of the plot’s execution.",

Overall, it would lead to a 7% reduction in Europe’s microplastic pollution, according to the European Commission.“The most important thing is to cut pollution at the source,” said Virginijus Sinkevičius, EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, in an interview with the Guardian. “What we are looking to do is basically ensure we drastically cut, at the source, pollution of microplastics.”Tiny, durable pellets of plastic – also known as nurdles or nibs – are melted down and reformed into everyday products, from office chairs to water bottles. But they leak into the environment at every stage of the supply chain.Over time, they break down into microplastics that are eaten and drunk by people and animals. The commission estimates between 52,000 and 184,000 tons of plastic pellets are released into the environment in the EU each year.Glitter sales surge in Germany before EU microplastics ban this weekRead moreDana Kühnel, from the Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research, said: “Preventing plastic release is much more effective than managing microplastics.”As part of its push to cut microplastic pollution 30% by 2030, the commission wants operators who handle pellets to take precautions that keep them from harming nature. In order of importance, it wants them to prevent spills, contain spills that do happen, and clean up after spills that are not contained.The proposal includes best handling practices for operators and mandatory certifications from an independent third party. But smaller operators will simply be allowed to “self declare” that they have complied with the rules.“There are lighter requirements for small and medium-sized enterprises to reduce the economic burden,” said Sinkevičius.On Sunday a separate ban on some products that contain microplastics, like glitter and other cosmetics, came into force. The move caused panic among influencers and led to an increase in sales in Germany.",

Federal police in Nova Scotia charged two men over the alleged attack. Police later discovered a stun gun and shotgun after searching vehicles, as well as a shotgun discarded on the road. Indigenous leaders also believe a shooting in early April was linked to an eel fishery dispute, though police say they do not have any evidence to support the claims.“[The fisheries department] appears to be doing little to control unlawful elver harvest activity and to make sure our Kespukwitk fishers are safe from violence,” Chief Gerald Toney of the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs said in a statement. “This is unacceptable, and it is time that federal officers start taking steps to ensure the safety of all.”The season to harvest glass eels is relatively brief, beginning in March and typically running until May as fishers frantically harvest the region’s rivers for the glistening juveniles. Coveted in China and Japan, where they are grown on farms and harvested for food, the translucent fish command a steep price, with buyers paying $5,000 a kg last year.Canada’s endangered wildlife committee designated the species as “threatened” more than a decade ago, and the federal government has put limits on the harvest. The total allowable catch for 2023 is 9,960kg, unchanged over the last 18 years.In recent years, however, Indigenous nations have grown frustrated that their treaty rights have not been recognised by the federal government.",

California is also running pilot projects to relocate beavers to places where they can be more beneficial.Catch her if you can: viral surfboard-swiping otter is on the loose, and fans love itRead moreThe aim is to preserve more beavers, along with their nature-friendly behaviors, including creating lush habitats that lure species back into now-urban areas, enhance groundwater supplies and buffer against the threat of wildfires.“There’s been this major paradigm shift throughout the west where people have really transitioned from viewing beavers strictly as a nuisance species, and recognizing them for the ecological benefits that they have,” said Valerie Cook, the beaver restoration program manager for California’s department of fish and wildlife.The push follows similar efforts in other western states including Washington, which has a pilot beaver relocation program, Cook said. It marks a new chapter in Californians’ lengthy history with the animals, which experts say used to be everywhere, but after years of trapping, attempts at reintroduction and then removal, they are found in much smaller numbers than they once were – largely in the Central valley and the northern part of the state.It is unknown how many beavers live in California, but hundreds of permits are sought by landowners each year that typically allow them to kill the animals.

The company denies liability. It is facing claims for compensation amounting to £36bn in the world’s largest group claim in English legal history.In November 2015, the Fundão tailings dam, which BHP co-owned with the Brazilian iron ore producer Vale, burst. It unleashed 60m cubic metres of toxic waste, which obliterated land below and polluted everything in its path for more than 600km.The waste killed 19 people, buried villages, made thousands homeless and affected the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands more. The impact continues to wreak havoc on the ecosystem and environment, as well as on people’s health.“We believe BHP is guilty of environmental racism,” said the letter, delivered to 10 Downing Street on Thursday by some of those affected. “It is our Indigenous communities who have been most affected by the disaster; our communities who were most at risk from mining activities; and our communities that continue to be denied justice by BHP.”A spokesman for BHP said the company “strongly refutes any accusations of environmental racism”. In Brazil, BHP, along with Vale, and Samarco, the joint venture company responsible for managing the Fundão dam, established the Renova Foundation to provide compensation for individuals and some businesses for loss and damages, as well as mitigating the disaster’s environmental impacts. It has funded more than $6bn (£4.58bn) of rehousing, rehabilitation and indemnification for all communities affected by the disaster, he added.The issue was discussed in British parliament last month. Tan Dhesi, the Labour MP for Slough, said: “Companies running large operations worldwide cannot be allowed to hide behind their subsidiaries when things go wrong or when there is an ecological and environmental disaster.

In the Po River delta, however, such efforts have proven largely ineffective.A fisherman tips out a bucket of blue crabs harvested in the Scardovari lagoon south of Venice.

The admission came as she announced a new environmental plan for England that held back from banning wood-burning stoves and settled instead for “educating” people on their use.The Times subsequently reported that the government would encourage councils to use their powers to issue householders £300 on-the-spot fines for flouting air pollution rules by burning logs at home.But the Green party co-leader Carla Denyer said the government should go further and potentially end the sale of log burners.She said: “Local authorities have powers to create smoke control areas in cities under the Environment Act 2021. This goes some way to preventing homeowners and businesses releasing smoke from a chimney. However, there are exemptions for particular stoves and fuels which still mean dangerous particulates can be released into the atmosphere.My burning shame: I fitted my house with three wood-burning stoves | George MonbiotRead more“We need an urgent review into the impacts of smoke from chimneys on public health in high-density housing areas, with a view to putting an end to future sales of log burners and fuels if they are shown to have an unacceptable detrimental impact.”The environment charity ClientEarth, which has won pollution cases against the government, has said the burners need to be phased out. Andrea Lee, from the charity, said: “Pollution from wood-burning is a growing source of fine particulate matter pollution in some areas, which is a serious threat to people’s health.”The Liberal Democrats have called for more powers for local councils to stop the use of polluting burners. A spokesperson said they were disappointed that it had taken so long for the ban on house coal and wet wood to come through.“The new eco-design has reduced air pollution from wood burners but more needs to be done including encouraging households to replace older wood burners with the new design.

Popular across the whole of south Asia, it normally consists of something fried, such as a poppadom, samosa or pakora, that is usually crushed up and loaded with a variety of flavourful spicy, sweet and salty chutneys and crunchy treats. It’s often finished off with a sev (fried gram flour vermicelli) topping (if you can’t find sev, Bombay mix works fine, too). One of my favourite chaats features spinach fried in chickpea flour batter; this beetroot leaf version makes a tasty, colourful and thrifty replacement.Beetroot leaf chaatFor this year’s Ramadan, the charity Islamic Relief invited me to write a few low-waste recipes for its #FastOnWaste campaign. I gave them three: a moussaka with lentils, spinach and seasonal root veg, a spring tabbouleh with millet, and a smashed beetroot and chickpea chaat. This take on the latter uses beetroot leaves to make delicious pakoras by coating them in chickpea flour batter and frying until golden and crunchy. Make sure you wash the leaves and stalks very well, because they are often full of soil. The leaves need to be nice and dry for the batter to stick, too, so if need be, pat them in a clean tea towel.

In the case of the water companies, most of them were privatised as sensibly capitalised plcs. As local monopolies, they were regulated by Ofwat with a view to protecting customers from monopolistic pricing behaviour.This approach was carefully thought through by the government on the basis of the business and demographic environment of the time. For some years this worked well in terms of operational efficiency, reliability of water supply and water treatment, and was a good deal for the customer – perhaps too good.However, from about the start of the 21st century, two key issues were allowed to arise – neither of which was addressed by successive governments – that had not been envisaged at the time of privatisation.The first was that these sensibly capitalised plcs were acquired by private equity and infrastructure funds, largely based outside the UK. They used substantial amounts of debt for acquisition, with a view to paying down the debt as rapidly as possible from the strong positive cashflows that these companies generated; this in order to maximise the equity returns. Second, extraordinarily, this policy was aided and abetted by the regulatory regime.This regime disincentivised companies from investing for the long term, in an attempt to minimise water price increases for customers. This was at a time of significant population and housing growth, leading to increased demand for water supply and treatment.There needs to be a policy of marrying housebuilding and development targets with water and other infrastructureDespite warnings to successive governments of impending serious problems, nothing was done. The result is we now have a water industry that is probably 15 to 20 years behind in terms of infrastructure investment. The recent statements coming from ministers, and their lack of a coherent long-term policy, bodes ill for the UK.",

The data provided to ministers also states that “in the 200 most disadvantaged lower super output areas in urban settings with the lowest levels of green space, 97% have no access to green space within 15 minutes’ walk from home”.The documents reveal that the government rejected the idea of making the target legally binding, meaning it does not have to fulfil its promise.Notes show that the former environment secretary George Eustice “queried the idea of a top-down target”, while Defra officials noted there were “challenges associated with setting a legally binding target”.Guy Shrubsole, from the Right to Roam campaign, said: “A year after making their access commitment, ministers still have no idea how on earth to meet it. And having rejected setting a legal target for increasing access, the government is clearly only interested in spinning good headlines rather than improving the nation’s health and wellbeing.“The next government needs to be bold and give the public a default right of responsible access with sensible exceptions.",

What was my favourite animal, she inquired reasonably. “I hate all animals,” I replied, “apart from maybe squirrels or frogs.” Twenty-two years later, I would like to plead diminished responsibility. This wasn’t really my view, but that of my mum, who really did hate animals.So, naturally, we weren’t allowed pets. For a long time, the closest I got was fostering the primary school stick insects during holidays. (I can still tell you the delicate difference between a stick insect poo and an egg. The egg has a dot on it. The other is just a poo.) Then, in year five, I came across Sea-Monkeys. It was the late 90s, and they were marketed as educational toys and sold in bookshops. With all due respect to the late Sea-Monkeys inventor Harold von Braunhut, they are one of history’s greatest cons.Sea-Monkeys start life as brine shrimp eggs contained in a sachet: tip them in water and they start to hatch. In the 60s and 70s, they were advertised in comics using illustrations of human-like figures. Apparently, many buyers were disappointed by the dissimilarity, such was the strength of Von Braunhut’s con. Sea-Monkeys actually look like swimming head lice, though, at first, they look like nothing at all – which won me the prize for smallest pet at pet day.I became aggressively proud of my Sea-Monkeys. Not only were they prize-winners, but nobody else had them (and, surely, nobody else wanted them). I obsessively browsed the accompanying leaflet that advertised such marvels as “The Great Sea-Monkey Baseball Game” and a racetrack. While I wasn’t sure that my vacant little swimmers even knew up from down, Von Braunhut had prepared me for magic to happen before my very eyes, and I begged to buy it. Unsurprisingly, this was a non-starter.So my artemia crew swam around idly behind the kitchen sink until mum accidentally knocked them out of the window.",

Other trustees announced on Friday include Mel Austen, a professor of ocean and society at the University of Plymouth, and Lynn Dicks, who leads a research group working on sustainable agriculture and insect conservation.Questions have been raised over the appropriateness of the appointment, as the former environment secretary previously had to apologise for trying to privatise England’s woodland.Her plans to change the ownership of 258,000 hectares (637,000 acres) of state-owned woodland in 2011 were widely criticised at the time and caused a Tory revolt. She had to take part in a humiliating climbdown in front of fellow MPs. She said at the time: “I have taken a decision to end the consultation on the future of the public forest estate and I take full responsibility for that. I am doing so because it is quite clear from the early responses to the consultation that the public and many honourable members are not happy with the proposals we set out.”The shadow environment secretary, Jim McMahon, raised questions over the appropriateness of her appointment. “It appears the conveyor belt of Conservative cronyism is alive and well,” he said.“The decision to appoint the former secretary of state for the environment who attempted to sell off England’s forests to the board of Natural England raises serious questions of judgment from Defra ministers.“Natural England exists to conserve our natural environment for the benefit of future generations. This flies in the face of somebody who thought it appropriate to sell off some of our most treasured environmental assets.",

The debate is this: the forecast gale is coming from a different direction to normal and Dad says we need a second rope to secure the tree (it is already permanently tied to prevent it falling into stables). Meanwhile, my brother says that if it is likely to come down, it’s better that it goes the other way.On a farm with public land, managing this kind of risk is part of the job, and trees near buildings, roads and paths must be checked carefully. We have just received a notice from the council that a large limb overhanging the road must be removed. It is being attacked by fungus.I’m still chilled by a particular sports day at my child’s primary school, when just an hour after the refreshments stand was tidied away, a huge potentially child-squashing branch fell to exactly where we’d all been gathered. That tree was regularly inspected.This autumn, there has been a high risk of trees falling. The ground is saturated, making them easier to topple, and many deciduous trees are still in almost full leaf, so are more vulnerable to the force of the wind. It was these same conditions that made the October 1987 gales so devastating.A decision is made, and Dad descends the ladder. The oak is left with just one rope, to face whatever the storm brings. The gusts pick up and anything unfixed starts flying round the yard. Horses are unsettled, their raised heads appearing over stable doors.We sit out the weather. This time, wind speeds remain moderate, although the rain buckets down. The oak stands sturdy. A giant, curved specimen is lost in the woods, though.",

I just hope people are smart enough not to do it. There are much safer ways to get just as much attention.”The managing director of Silverstone, Stuart Pringle, was equally blunt in his statement that protesters such as the Just Stop Oil group that have targeted sporting events, such as the Ashes Test at Lord’s, the Premiership rugby final and the World Snooker Championship, would be taking a severe risk in attempting similar actions at the race this weekend.“You are not putting your life in danger when you sit on a snooker table or protest at a flower show,” Pringle said. “A motor racing track is not the place to go. It is extraordinarily dangerous and people will be putting lives at risk if they go there, and any sensible, right-thinking person can extrapolate what the ultimate risk here is. My strong, strong message is: ‘Do not put your life in danger. This is not the place to go and sit on a floor’. It is absolute madness if someone climbs on to a live racing track.”The British GP is one of the biggest sporting events of the year and last year attracted Formula One’s largest global attendance.

This poses a substantial threat to the planet’s biodiversity, a new study warns.Under a high emissions scenario of 4.4C warming, 41% of land vertebrates will experience extreme thermal events by 2099, according to the paper, published in Nature.In worse affected regions, such as the Mojave desert in the US, Gran Chaco in South America, the Sahel and Sahara in Africa and parts of Iran and Afghanistan, 100% of species would be exposed to extreme heat. It is not possible to say if these areas would be uninhabitable, but it is likely that more species would become extinct.A desert tortoise in the Mojave desert in California, US, an area that would be one of the worse hit by extreme heat. Photograph: Scott Trageser/AlamyResearchers mapped the effects of extreme heat on more than 33,000 land vertebrates by looking at maximum temperature data between 1950 and 2099. They considered five predictions of global climatic models based on different levels of greenhouse gas emission, as well as the distribution of terrestrial vertebrates, to work out how exposed animal populations would be.“A couple of studies have shown recent climate warming trends match the 4.4C scenario much better than the other scenarios,” said lead author Gopal Murali, who was at Ben-Gurion University of Negev, Israel when he carried out the research. “We wanted to highlight the disastrous consequences for wildlife if we end up with a high, unmitigated emission scenario.”Amphibians and reptiles were most affected, with 55% and 51% respectively likely to experience extreme heat events by the end of the century, compared with 26% of birds and 31% of mammals. Amphibians and reptiles are most vulnerable because they generally live within smaller temperature ranges.Under 3.6C of warming, 29% of terrestrial vertebrates will experience extreme heat events, according to the report.",

If it is clear, the moon and stars illuminate the tiny island vividly; when it is cloudy, the darkness is thick and unbroken, “bible black” to quote Dylan Thomas.Ynys Enlli (Bardsey Island), two miles off the mainland of north-west Wales, has become the first site in Europe to receive international dark sky sanctuary certification, joining just 16 other spots in some of the most remote places in the world.The island (permanent human population two in the winter, about a dozen in the summer) is off-grid and there are hardly any lights outside, with most of the buildings unchanged since they were built in the 19th century.A small mountain shields most of the island from the tiny bit of light that may spill from the mainland, and the closest major light pollution comes from Dublin, more than 70 miles away across the Irish Sea.The lighthouse has been switched from a sweeping white beam to a flashing red light designed not to impinge on the night. It means that when the sun goes down the island is, as the Welsh expression has it, “Yn dywyll fel bola buwch” – “as dark as a cow’s belly”.Mari Huws, who works as a warden on the island with her partner, Emyr Owen, said it was a privilege to live there all year round.The lighthouse at Ynys Enlli has a red light that does not impinge on the night.

We think a similar picture will appear from all of the water companies and it is good to see Thames Water standing out and opening its doors a little wider.”The data shows that in some locations, hundreds of hours of raw sewage is being discharged through storm overflows. At Marsh Gibbon, a village in Buckinghamshire, raw sewage was discharged on 19 December for 395 hours (16 days). A storm overflow at Standlake in west Oxfordshire discharged 122 hours of raw sewage into the River Windrush on New Year’s Eve. At Windsor, discharges into the River Thames carried on for four hours on Wednesday.Southern Water also publishes data on sewage releases into waterways, but Thames Water is the first company to provide information on inland waterways being subjected to raw sewage discharges.Dee O’Connell, of London Waterkeeper, a group pushing Thames Water to provide real-time data on sewage releases, said: “We need to make sure the data is accurate, but this is important because it gives communities information and enables them to put pressure on the company to invest in local areas to stop this. With this knowledge people can hold the water company to account.”The data also shows where storm overflow monitors are not working.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In Australia, almost nine out of 10 plant species fit that bill.But the nation isn’t doing what’s needed to understand if they are in trouble.“By international standards, Australia performed very poorly in conservation assessments,” said Western Sydney University’s Rachael Gallagher, who led the global evaluation of those efforts.Only 39% of Australia’s unique species have had their threats and conservation status assessed – less than half of what New Zealand and South Africa have managed.Australia’s efforts were more on par with low-income countries such as Madagascar, on 42%.“Without comprehensive assessment thousands of unique Australian plant and fungi species could be at risk, and we have no way of knowing which species or where to direct conservation efforts,” Gallagher said.The New South Wales floral emblem, the waratah, is a perfect example. Its extinction risk has never been assessed even though it is targeted by illegal flower collectors, and threatened by climate change and altered fire regimes.Australia is also home to about 1,000 of the world’s 1,350 acacia, or wattle, species. But there’s been no threat assessment for almost half of those 1,000.The University of Queensland’s Prof Hugh Possingham also worked on the assessment and said it’s time for Australia to lift its game.“More than half of the world’s plants – 221,399 species – occur in only one country.

Better insulated homes could help save the NHS about £2bn by preventing millions of people from developing respiratory conditions including asthma, it said.Using less energy could save an estimated £4bn worth of investment in infrastructure such as new electricity networks and substations needed to meet the UK’s growing demand for electricity. It would also reduce emissions from power plants by 5%, thus cutting air pollution, and bring a £2.7bn benefit to society, the report found.Dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “The impact of raising minimum energy standards would be profound: giving a boost to household budgets, improving people’s health, increasing energy security and helping the UK reach its net zero targets.”The government has been criticised for dragging its feet on enacting proposals that would force landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their properties to at least an EPC rating of C by 2028. Privately rented homes are only required to meet an E rating.Research by the Energy and Climate Intelligence unit thinktank has found that delaying the measures to 2030 could add £1bn to the energy bills of 2.4m of the UK’s leakiest homes.Moriarty said the Citizens Advice report showed insulating homes was “about so much more than reducing energy bills. It’s a long-term solution that makes running the NHS cheaper and boosts quality of life in areas that need it most.”“The government must make improving our draughty homes a top priority,” she added.",

Right now the expansion of electricity production in Sweden is through wind power,” he told the Guardian. “I don’t expect any new nuclear power in Sweden, unless the government provides quite far-reaching guarantees similar to what you have at Hinkley Point [in the UK].”The move was more about posturing than action, he said, claiming the government wanted to show it was taking action on meeting its climate goals. “I see it more as symbolic than actually creating any real change.”If the reactors were built the costs were likely to fall heavily on the Swedish taxpayer, said Nilsson. Having been a hotly debated issue in the past, this latest announcement had had a “lukewarm response”.Sweden’s reputation as a green leader on the global stage was shifting, he said. “Sweden will partly lose that profile. Now the momentum and progressiveness is coming from the EU and Brussels.”The EU’s Fit for 55 plan legally requires member states to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and become “climate neutral” by 2050.Sweden’s Moderates agreed when they formed a coalition government with the Christian Democrats, Liberals and the far-right Sweden Democrats that more reactors would be permitted and that investments in nuclear power would be made profitable through credit guarantees and changes to pricing.",

My only caveat is his repeated use of the word “could”, which overeggs the possibility of an alternative future where the biospheric tipping points into catastrophe are avoided.Even if human carbon emissions and destructive developments in primary nature miraculously cease tomorrow, the planet will continue to heat because releases from natural sources will not stop. They include carbon and methane from permafrost and gas hydrates in shallow polar waters, collapsing forests and wetlands, increased water vapour, and the loss of reflective albedo from polar and mountain ice melt, meaning further atmospheric and ocean warming etc. That is the “doom loop”.Every tenth of a degree less matters.

Between 40% and 70% of dormice die during the hibernation period.Ian White, a dormouse officer at PTES, said: “There’s an old Worcestershire saying: ‘Woods don’t grow beneath trees’, and we no longer have this complexity and under-storey in woods because of increased browsing by deer, but also increased shading – we don’t cut our woodlands enough.“It’s a double-whammy. Now winters are becoming more mild and variable, there’s a danger that dormice will wake up and they can only do that so many times before they run out of energy. Wetter springs and summers also stop dormice feeding because their fur is not waterproof [so they don’t go out in rain], and they only produce on average four young per year – they don’t have the breeding potential of mice and rats.“If the decline continues at the same rate, in another 30 years dormouse populations will have fallen by 94% since 2000, which we simply cannot let happen.”With its caramel fur, big black eyes and furry tail, the hazel dormouse, or Muscardinus avellanarius, is a flagship species for the conservation of many woodlands.

Ministers in the government of national unity, based in the west of the country, were nominated by militia. In the east, a relentless centralisation drive by the authoritarian head of the Libyan National Army, Gen Khalifa Haftar, and his family similarly ended up with numerous executives nominated by Haftar or his associates.MapThe two sides were at all-out war as recently as 2020. Hafter’s forces besieged Tripoli in a year-long failed military campaign to try to capture the capital in which thousands of people were killed. Then in 2022, the former leader of the eastern administration Fathi Bashagha tried to move his government into Tripoli before clashes between rival militias forced him to withdraw. This rumbling, mostly low-intensity conflict, requiring leaders to assuage their base with handouts, is the worst environment in which to make infrastructure investments that reap rewards only in the long term.",

It will do nothing to alter its public reputation; most visitors are oblivious to sponsorship, and those more aware know their own minds. We live in a world built on oil. That is changing, but essential emissions targets will not be met without action from oil producers.Colourful, principled protest may feel like help, but in reality it does more to allow the smug to brand change as the realm of the hypocritical and rude, when of course it is about us all. If you care about the future, support rapid green transitions – write to your MP (and BP), don’t object to windfarms, don’t spread scare stories about electric cars, use your vote to oust deniers and delayers, and consider your own lifestyle. And if you care about the British Museum, give it a pass on its efforts to survive.Mike PittsMarlborough, Wiltshire Well done to the British Museum for securing funding for its redevelopment (British Museum’s BP sponsorship deal ‘astonishingly out of touch’, 19 December). While I condemn BP as a business promoting fossil fuels, I cannot condemn the museum for accepting its money. Culture Unstained, as one campaign group is called, risks meaning “culture unsustained”.

EU countries’ ambassadors on Friday cancelled the vote that had been planned for 7 March, the spokesperson for Sweden said.That has put the law on ice days before it was due to receive final approval. An attempt to block or change an EU policy this late in the lawmaking process is highly unusual.German transport minister, Volker Wissing, reiterated on Friday that the use of synthetic fuels should remain possible after the 2035 deadline and that the European Commission’s promised proposal on how to make this happen was still missing.“We want climate-neutral mobility,” and to do so means being open to all conceivable technologies, he told a news conference.A non-binding section of the EU law says the Commission will make a proposal on how vehicles running on CO2-neutral fuels can be sold after 2035, if this complies with climate goals. But Germany’s transport ministry wants clearer assurances.A Commission spokesperson on Friday said it “will consider the potential contribution of CO2-neutral fuels to reach climate neutral mobility”, adding that it was in contact with countries to discuss their issues with the law.“The transition to zero-emission vehicles is absolutely necessary to meet our 2030 and 2050 climate targets,” the spokesperson added.Transport accounts for nearly a quarter of EU emissions and has bucked the EU’s overall trend of falling CO2 output over the past three decades, threatening to thwart the bloc’s targets to slash planet-warming emissions.",

But now experts have said they believe climate activists’ most important weapon could be “the strategic use of nonviolent disruptive tactics”.Nearly seven in 10 of academics surveyed rated disruptive protest tactics as “at least quite important” to success of a movement, ranking it as more important than gaining media coverage or even strictly avoiding violent tactics.The findings will boost the morale of climate activists, often derided as “eco-zealots” causing chaos for “hardworking people”. The results also contradict public opinion: polling by YouGov in February shows the vast majority (78%) of Britons think disruptive protest hinders activists’ causes.The findings come as Just Stop Oil’s supporters complete their 12th week of slow marching protests on London’s streets and amid uproar about lengthy queues at Wimbledon, where security was tightened to counter climate protests.James Özden, director of Social Change Lab, the protest thinktank that organised the survey, said: “We were really struck by the contradiction between what the public and media say about disruptive protests and what academics said. The experts who study social movements not only believe that strategic disruption can be an effective tactic, but that it is the most important tactical factor for a social movement’s success.“This points out how our intuitions can be flawed when it comes to understanding social change, and how we shouldn’t take people’s first reactions as the indicator of an effective protest.”Apollo Surveys, which specialises in academic surveys, polled 120 experts in sociology, political science and related disciplines for Social Change Lab, asking them what makes some social movements more successful than others.Protest groups, in particular climate activists, have in recent years escalated the scale and frequency of disruptive protests. Just Stop Oil has staged slow march protests in London almost daily for the past 12 weeks, while also targeting high-profile events such as Wimbledon, Pride, the Ashes, the Glyndebourne festival and the Premiership rugby final.",

Breeding populations of moorland birds such as golden plover, red grouse and ring ouzels have gone or are on the verge of being lost.Natural England, the government nature watchdog, has advised farmers who are in agri-environment schemes and receive government money for nature-friendly farming that they will have to reduce their stocks. It said that in summer, at least 50% of their livestock units should be cattle or ponies rather than sheep, and that “except for pony herds, winter grazing will need to be justified through clear and specific environmental outcomes that require winter stocking”.Sources at the quango said that of the three largest moorland sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) – north Dartmoor, south Dartmoor and east Dartmoor – none of the key open moorland habitats, such as bog and heath, are considered to be in favourable condition.Critics argue that farmers should not be paid millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money for environmental stewardship without changing their practices when the habitats are being degraded.But the suggestion has been met with concern by local MPs. Sir Geoffrey Cox, a former attorney general, published a statement with other local Conservative MPs last week saying: “It seems that valuable and constructive work has now been abandoned by Natural England which has issued apparently peremptory limits on grazing, which would have a significant adverse impact on farm businesses (especially tenants), rendering some, if not many, no longer viable. It would also destroy the ancient traditional hefted flocks, which instinctively know the boundaries of their own common and are themselves a prized part of the unique life and culture of Dartmoor.”Cox, Gary Streeter, the MP for South West Devon, and Anthony Mangnall, the MP for Totnes, have asked for the current grazing regime to be kept in place for an extra 12 months, the appointment of an independent facilitator, and then an agreed “roadmap” for the way forward.",

Among the decisions they must make at the UN conference will be whether to agree, for the first time, to gradually “phase out” fossil fuels.Research has shown that switching from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy sources would save many lives from air pollution and help combat global heating. However, until now, mortality estimates have varied widely.A new modelling study suggests air pollution, from the use of fossil fuels in industry, power generation, and transportation, accounts for 5.1 million avoidable deaths a year globally. These findings were published in The BMJ.The contribution of fossil fuels equates to 61% of a total estimated 8.3 million deaths worldwide due to outdoor air pollution from all sources in 2019.The new estimates of fossil fuel-related deaths are larger than most previously reported values, suggesting that phasing out fossil fuels might have a greater impact on attributable mortality than previously thought.deaths from air pollution“Our results suggest that a global phase-out of fossil fuels will have large health benefits, much larger than indicated by most previous studies,” the global team of researchers wrote in the BMJ. “These data support increasing the share of clean, renewable energy, advocated by the UN through the sustainable development goals for 2030 and the ambition of climate neutrality for 2050.”Ambient air pollution is the leading environmental health risk factor for illness and death, but few global studies have attributed deaths to specific air pollution sources and their results widely differ.To address this, an international team of researchers from the UK, US, Germany, Spain and Cyprus, used a new model to estimate deaths due to air pollution related to fossil fuels, and to assess potential health benefits from policies that replace fossil fuels with clean, renewable energy sources.They assessed excess deaths using data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study, as well as Nasa satellite-based fine particulate matter and population data, and atmospheric chemistry, aerosol, and relative risk modelling for 2019.",

In June 2022, advisers at Barclays were appointed to lead the search for investors in the huge project.The government and EDF have each taken a 20% stake in the project. Ministers hope the Suffolk plant will mark the next phase of a planned nuclear renaissance in the UK and have so far pumped in £700m.They have also made £511m available to continue project development and prepare the site for construction, ahead of the planned equity raise for the project. Estimates on its overall cost and build time, expected to be at least £20bn, have varied significantly.Funding for the scheme faced upheaval after the government forced out the Chinese state-backed nuclear company CGN, which initially had a 20% stake, amid security concerns over Beijing’s further involvement in UK nuclear.CGN has part-funded the Hinkley Point C in Somerset, a sister project to Sizewell C based on the same designs.The government said on Monday that “any investment will also be subject to strict national security checks”. Investors in the United Arab Emirates, Australia and Saudi Arabia have reportedly already been approached, while the idea of publicly floating a stake in the project has also been touted, although this strategy is unlikely.Nuclear industry sources said that efforts to get pension funds to invest in the project had stalled, and that the prospect of a general election next year could hold up the financing process.",

More than half – 55% – of the country’s total river length showed “moderate or severe impairment” from organic pollution or nutrient enrichment – typically caused by effluent and runoff from farming, and 45% of rivers were unswimmable, due to campylobacter infection risk.‘Like you’re in a horror movie’: pollution leaves New Zealand wetlands irreversibly damagedRead moreThe report “unflinchingly identifies the appalling state of lowland freshwaters of Aotearoa,” Mike Joy, a senior freshwater and governance researcher at Victoria University of Wellington, said. Prof Jenny Webster-Brown, president of the Freshwater Sciences Society, called it “dismal”. The report “should be able to galvanise the stewards of our environment into action,” she said. “We know what needs to be done to reverse these trends.”Sewage overflows emptied into freshwater systems at a rate of more than 11 a day. Wastewater service providers reported more than 4,200 overflows due to wet weather events, or blockages and failures during dry weather between July 2020 and June 2021. “People’s health is put at risk by pollution from sources such as wastewater overflows and livestock runoff,” the report concluded.Dr Tim Chambers, a senior public health research fellow at the University of Otago, said the results were “sobering”.Behind many of the results lies New Zealand’s rapid intensification of dairy farming, to feed its export markets. The dairy industry now forms a significant chunk of New Zealand’s economy, accounting for about 3% of GDP and 20% of total exports in 2020 – around $17bn of export revenue each year.",

What real jackasses you are!’ he’d say with a hearty laugh that reverberated through the apartment, then he’d eat the pear in two bites.”You can feel it: the almost alcoholic impression a very ripe pear leaves somewhere between your throat and your lungs, a smell more than a taste. It’s the thing that makes a pear drop a pear drop. It’s the thing that makes it feel like you breathed the pear in, that a moment ago it was a piece of fruit in a dark and golden painting, then it was gone.But there is evidence: the stem, the thing that reminds you that the fruit once weighed down a branch in a heavy orchard, something happening to move that weight from the soil to the trees, to move down again, the pear seeming to weigh itself down with that shape, a drop of water falling back to the ground.The word pear comes from the Vulgar Latin word pira. In biology class we learned that the hard bits, especially in an unripe pear, are called sclereid bundles, or stone cells. We looked at them under the microscope, focusing the lens until the blurred dots turned to thin lines: dead cells with thick walls.Sometimes (especially when I am hungover) I feel my mind is a microscope, zooming in and zooming out, from the simple explanation to the more complicated one. Let us have a debate, someone in there announces, and it begins. Perhaps the explanation is this – but it could equally be this – No no, my dear fellow, it is clearly this – No sir, your reasoning, like your Latin, is vulgar!

This has seen Labour aping Jeremy Hunt’s ludicrous emphasis on reducing the national debt. Instead, Labour must become leader of a pack of opposition parties all demanding a massive increase in expenditure on social and green infrastructure, and on the wages and conditions of those working in these areas. One recent estimate suggests that to achieve this, the next government will need to invest £220bn per year.All opposition parties should promise the next parliament will use its powers to provide the money needed to fix broken Britain. This can come from three sources. First, the estimated £55bn a year of tax breaks for pension savers must be redesigned to support employment-creating investment with social and environmental goals, as should some of the £70bn a year saved tax-free in Isas – a much-needed exercise in intergenerational solidarity.Second, increased revenue from a fairer taxation system, where the wealthier contribute far more. Finally, as a backstop for any funding shortfalls, quantitative easing should be restarted. What Labour and indeed all the opposition parties have got to grasp is that you can’t have the necessary equivalent of Roosevelt’s New Deal without a massive increase in new debt. The £28bn is a mere down payment.Colin HinesConvener, UK Green New Deal Group Rachel Reeves would have more fiscal headroom for increased green investment if she introduced an overseas tax liability for British citizens, avoiding vast amounts of tax, including on offshore-owned British assets. This could be similar to the US Internal Revenue Service requirements for Americans and resident aliens living abroad. They are expected to pay taxes according to the Internal Revenue Code, which includes tax credits for paying foreign taxes where you are living, deductions and exclusions.We cannot afford to repeat the 1997 Labour government’s mistake of sticking to fictional Tory spending plans, rather than bringing our economy gradually towards sustainable German levels of taxation, and this time really invest in decent public services.",

They were told the resulting soil contamination would make it hard to plant the trees, so they had decided to cancel the woodland.Assessments are being done by United Utilities and council officials to find out the scale of the problem, but the council said it had decided there were too many risks to human health, including workers having to dig into raw sewage to plant trees, and there were worries the contaminants would prevent the trees growing.The council-owned land by Otterspool Road in Romiley.This is a fresh blow to attempts by local councils to create green spaces to improve local areas in the face of funding cuts and battles to keep existing spaces open.Raw sewage contains many problematic elements, including heavy metals that can be toxic to plants, and nutrients that can disturb ecosystems.According to Environment Agency data, United Utilities discharged sewage at Otterspool Road 135 times last year, which amounted to 40 days of sewage flowing.The water company was found to be the most polluting in the country last year. One of United Utilities’ pipes spilled sewage into the River Ellen, near the Lake District, for nearly 7,000 hours in 2022. Environment Agency data also showed that 10 of the country’s 20 pipes that spilled the most sewage in 2022 were owned by United Utilities, which provides water to the north-west and the Lake District.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We’ve had false starts before, but this week the change in the season finally felt real – a spring we could trust. Almost a whole week of sun, barely a cloud in the sky. All around, skylarks are lifting as smoothly and cleanly as elevators into the still air.Yesterday evening, I loaded the horse into the trailer and trundled down the road to the community arena. The Old Finstown Road cuts inland between Keelylang and Wideford Hill, through pastureland then open heath. The road is winding, so I took it steady, windows open, soaking up the late golden light gilding the soft curves of the land.‘Our next act was something a little different: a female kestrel hovering about 30 feet in the air, wobbling slightly as she balanced on the breeze like a tightrope walker.’ Photograph: David Tipling Photo Library/AlamyThe conditions were perfect for bird-spotting.

They call them “catty faces” here – two small tufts of feathers pop up like eyebrows or small triangular ears – and they haunt the rough grass along the edges of the fields, looking for fat Orkney voles.

Overgrazing of sheep and cattle in the area has also been an issue.It is often referred to as one of the south-west’s last remaining examples of temperate rainforest, and came within Prince William’s purview after he inherited the duchy, a large landholding including the greatest privately owned area of Dartmoor national park, from his father, King Charles, when he succeeded to the throne.Wistman’s Wood contains very rare Atlantic mosses and lichens. Photograph: Ian G Dagnall/AlamyThe duchy has been criticised for failing to protect the sites of special scientific interest on its Dartmoor estate.Wistman’s Wood contains very rare Atlantic mosses and lichens, but is a small and isolated remnant, making it vulnerable to risks such as fire, disease and climate change, and increasing the need to carefully improve its resilience.But the duchy said on Monday it aimed to regenerate and at least double the size of Wistman’s Wood by 2040, including expanding wood-pasture habitat.The royal estate has been working with Natural England to restore the woodland and will allow it to regenerate naturally by reducing cattle grazing – using a virtual electric fence to protect sensitive areas, and improving footpaths so the public do not stray into the regenerating woodland. The Duchy will also plant some new trees by seed collected from the ancient wood.Wistman’s Wood is often referred to as one of the south-west’s last remaining examples of temperate rainforest. Photograph: David Clapp/Getty ImagesTony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, said: “Wistman’s Wood national nature reserve is a magical fragment of ancient temperate rainforest. This exciting plan to allow the wood to expand through regeneration will give it long-term resilience and provide a wealth of benefits for people and nature.",

The Environment Agency said on Thursday £5.3bn was being invested for the next five years to stop the further deterioration of waterways.But the summary documents within the plan reveal the target for all 3,651 water bodies to achieve good chemical and ecological status – a state in which they are as close to their natural state as possible – was now decades away in 2063.Until Brexit the UK government was signed up to the water framework directive, which required countries to make sure all their waters achieved “good” chemical and ecological status by 2027 at the latest. The UK government later reduced the target to 75% of waterways reaching the single test of good ecological status by 2027 at the latest. The target for the majority of waterways to achieve good status in both chemical and ecological tests has now been pushed back to 2063, according to the documents.By 2027, only 4% of waters are currently on track to be in good overall condition.The Wildlife Trusts said the new river basin management plans were the third instalment of proposals to restore nearly 5,000 rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters across England. Both previous plans from 2009 and 2015 were supposed to oversee the recovery of a large proportion of these waters by 2015 and 2021 – but the targets were missed and pushed back.Ali Morse, water policy manager for the Wildlife Trusts, said this new target of 2063 meant rivers, lakes and coastal waters would not be healthy within the lifetimes of many people. “For too long we have allowed our rivers and lakes to become poisoned, decimating aquatic wildlife and habitats.“We need ambitious targets to repair the immense damage inflicted on our natural world.",

Vegan diets also cut the destruction of wildlife by 66% and water use by 54%, the study found.The heavy impact of meat and dairy on the planet is well known, and people in rich nations will have to slash their meat consumption in order to end the climate crisis. But previous studies have used model diets and average values for the impact of each food type.In contrast, the new study analysed the real diets of 55,000 people in the UK. It also used data from 38,000 farms in 119 countries to account for differences in the impact of particular foods that are produced in different ways and places. This significantly strengthens confidence in the conclusions.However, it turned out that what was eaten was far more important in terms of environmental impacts than where and how it was produced. Previous research has shown that even the lowest-impact meat – organic pork – is responsible for eight times more climate damage than the highest-impact plant, oilseed.Scientists find vital missing ingredient for healthy vegan diet – algaeRead moreThe researchers said the UK should introduce policies to help people reduce the amount of meat they eat in order to meet the nation’s climate targets. Ministers have repeatedly said they will not tell people what to consume, despite the precedent of, for example, taxes on high-sugar drinks.Prof Peter Scarborough at Oxford University, who led the research, published in the journal Nature Food, said: “Our dietary choices have a big impact on the planet. Cutting down the amount of meat and dairy in your diet can make a big difference to your dietary footprint.”The global food system has a huge impact on the planet, emitting a third of the total greenhouse gas emissions driving global heating. It also uses 70% of the world’s freshwater and causes 80% of river and lake pollution.",

The findings were passed on to Tepco in 2008 – three years before the disaster when a 14-metre wave struck, the Kyodo news agency said.",

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Rob McLeod, policy manager at Australian nonprofit organisation Renew and the report author, travelled to Spain to investigate how cities are coping with the rising risks from heatwaves.Seville, in the country’s south, began naming heatwaves in 2022 as a way to increase public awareness of the risks from high temperatures.Between June and August 2023, Seville named four heatwaves – Yago, Xenia, Wenceslao and Vera.McLeod said: “They were hitting temperatures above 45C for at least three days. Naming heatwaves is about letting people know that this is a serious issue.”Should we name heatwaves as we do other extreme weather events?Read moreHe said Spanish cities were developing a “heat culture” where people understood the steps they needed to take to prepare for heatwaves, such as cooling their homes early in the morning and then using shading, doing outdoor tasks outside the hottest parts of the day, staying hydrated and checking on vulnerable community members.Naming heatwaves also created accountability around the actions that communities and government agencies needed to take to protect the public at a time when global heating was increasing the threat, McLeod said.City planners in Spain were also working to reduce the urban heat island effect – a phenomenon where impermeable hard surfaces like concrete and brick can store and reflect heat, exacerbating temperature extremes.Other steps being taken in Spain include a program to retrofit homes to make them cooler and setting up “cooling centres” alongside health teams during extreme events.“Heatwaves have killed more people in Australia than any other natural hazard,” McLeod said.",

        "text": "The UK will need to embrace innovative, community-based solutions to environmental and energy problems if it is to have any hope of meeting looming net-zero deadlines, a cross-party group of MPs and peers has recommended.A report by the all-party group on a green new deal argues for a combination of robust, top-down policies on green issues including localised power generation, food and transport schemes. Recommendations include a mortgage penalty for landlords who let energy-inefficient homes, and also real community decision-making, notably on power schemes.Highlighting projects such as one in Gwynedd, north Wales, in which locals buy electricity from a community hydroplant at below grid prices, with a further discount for off-peak use, they recommend changes to regulations to incentivise such schemes.As part of the “energy club” in Bethesda, homes pay as little as 8p per kW/h overnight, with bills staying lower than grid prices if they do not cumulatively use more energy than the local plant produces, with savings from power being generated nearby.One of the report’s recommendations is for a so-called right of local supply, as seen in some other European countries, which would incentivise such systems through improved access to the grid, and assistance with providing power to local people.Such changes are vital, the report said, if the UK is to meet the first of its major net zero targets, to reduce carbon emissions by 68% below 1990 levels by 2030.The report, based on a series of evidence sessions, including with academics, energy experts and devolved mayors, calls for ambitious centralised targets and incentives alongside localism, citing rules such as those in France obliging new buildings to have solar or natural roofs, and in Denmark and Netherlands where new developments are barred from being connected to the gas grid.More generally, the report says, the 2030 target should become a binding obligation for all projects planned by public sector organisations and agencies.Among ideas to improve home energy efficiency, the report says any buy-to-let rental properties with an energy performance certificate below C should face a 1% levy on mortgage interest – which would be fully refunded if the band was attained within three years.",

It is disingenuous to think that there are easy alternative funding solutions available. Would it be preferable not to have a book festival? Those who shut down conversations through boycotts and absolutism cause needless divisions that prohibit action.Book festivals that offer space for thought and debate, and inspire change across the generations are part of the solution. If the writers were serious about collective action instead of virtue signalling off the back of Greta Thunberg’s cancellation, they should be offering solutions not ultimatums, and campaigning on behalf of book festivals not against them.Name and address supplied As Charlotte Higgins points out in her article on the messy reality of greenwashing (Of course Greta Thunberg is right to call out greenwashing, but the reality can be messy, 11 August), absolutist actions have often been the fountainhead of change, particularly in social movements. However, those opposed to fossil fuels, more often than not forget how inextricably these fuels are tied to everyone’s daily lives, including theirs.Nearly everything we own comes from industry and almost every industry – including the book business – uses fossil fuels to some extent in the manufacture and distribution of its products. So a true boycott of financiers of fossil fuels is almost impossible, as is the boycott of industries that have an environmental impact. And frankly, if we do want to adopt a holier-than-thou stance, why end with fossil fuels?",

When the beach reopened, swimmers were advised to stay close to shore.“We want to make sure swimmers are safe,” George Gorman, Long Island State Parks regional director, told Newsday.The beach was closed once more after a possible shark sighting, but officials determined it was a dolphin.As defined by National Geographic, sand sharks is a catch-all name for species including the sand tiger or gray nurse shark, which has “a deceivingly ferocious look … large-bodied and display[ing] a mouthful of sharp teeth that protrude in all directions, even when the mouth is shut” but which is “a docile, non-aggressive species, known to attack humans only when bothered first”.Nonetheless, in New York state, after a spate of attacks last year, officials have increased patrols and deployed more drones.“We did have a season last year where we had six swimmers bitten from sharks, so this has turned into a bit of a concern,” Rodney Harrison, the Suffolk county police commissioner, told WABC.The incidents on Tuesday happened about 60 miles apart, including one off Fire Island Pines – not far from another attack the day before when a 15-year-old reported being bitten on a foot while surfing. Earlier on Monday, a 15-year-old girl was treated for an apparent bite to a leg.“She didn’t see what bit her, the lifeguards didn’t know what bit her, the drone operator checked the area, we didn’t see,” Gorman said. “So we can’t definitively say what bit her.”The Tuesday shark encounters both occurred just before 2pm.",

Under its former chief executive Paul Polman, who stepped down in 2019, Unilever positioned itself as a global leader on sustainability.Four years ago, the company’s outgoing head of nutrition, Hanneke Faber, described the type of multilayer plastic found in sachets as “evil” because it could not be recycled.However, research by the environment NGO Greenpeace has found that despite Unilever’s pledge to halve its use of virgin plastic by 2025, the company is on track to miss the target by nearly a decade.Nina Schrank, the head of plastics at Greenpeace UK, said: “Unilever really are pouring fuel on the fire of the plastic pollution crisis. Their brands like Dove are famous for telling the world they’re forces for good. But they’re pumping out a staggering amount of plastic waste. It’s poisoning our planet. You can’t claim to be a ‘purposeful’ company whilst bearing responsibility for such huge pollution. Unilever has to change.”The throwaway sachets of consumer products such as condiments, beauty and health products are marketed and sold in large quantities to the global south. Unilever says this is because “in several of our markets, plastic sachets allow low-income consumers an opportunity to buy small amounts of products – often ones that provide hygiene or nutrition benefits like shampoo, toothpaste and food – which they would otherwise not be able to afford”. The sachets, however, are also linked to pollution on land and in waterways, resulting in, for example, clogged drains, worsened flooding and threats to wildlife.Sachets produced by the Unilever brand Dove have been found polluting beaches and other waterways in the Philippines and Indonesia. Dove produced an estimated 6.4bn sachets in 2022.Greenpeace is urging Unilever to phase out single-use plastic in the next decade and begin by stopping the use of sachets.",

However, whether they would actually be built remained uncertain. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “This investment is not happening fast enough” for what was “the biggest energy system transformation since the introduction of electricity itself”, Westerman says in his written speech.“Bringing these new projects to market and connecting them into the grid urgently is critical to ensure consumers continue to have reliable power when they need it.”Westerman’s comments echo those of industry groups, such as the Clean Energy Council, which have warned that the influx of new renewables is faltering and could fall far short of the speed required to meet energy demand and the need to reduce emissions from the power sector. Electricity generation is the country’s largest source of carbon pollution.States such as New South Wales have recently announced that their plans to accelerate away from fossil fuels are running behind schedule. Snowy Hydro’s giant 2.0 pumped hydro project, the largest energy project in the country, is also years late and facing much higher costs than originally predicted.Westerman noted that were no new financial commitments on large-scale renewable energy generation signed in the first quarter of 2023. Only a single storage plant secured investment support.“One quarter doesn’t make a trend, but investment decisions are an important leading indicator for our energy transition,” he said.Aemo was working to support 163 projects with 27GW of capacity in eastern Australia that were at various stages of connection.",

But adding multiple layers, with intermingled planting, helps to mimic what one may find in a biodiverse forest, with each layer giving benefits for wildlife.“There’s a school of thought, or a concept, called a forest garden or a food forest,” said Massey, “and essentially it’s mimicking a natural forest. So you’ve got the canopy layer of the trees, you’ve got the climbing plants that scramble up the trees and climb on fences. You’ve then got the shrub layer, ground cover layer, you have mushrooms, you have this swale feature which holds water, and then you’ve got roots.“So it’s a kind of multilayer garden with high degrees of biodiversity, intermingled planting, so rather than just having a block of shrubs, it’s got lots of different species growing harmoniously together.”Tom Massey suggests adding about 30 plant species, from poppies to grasses to trees to climbing plants. Photograph: Random HouseMassey, who has displayed multiple times at Chelsea flower show, is launching a book with the Royal Horticultural Society about how to turn sterile, paved front gardens and heavily mown back gardens into havens for wildlife through planting forest gardens.Forest gardens have plant types of varying heights and are a good use for small plots because you are gardening from high areas to low. They support more wildlife as there are varying habitats and the planting is dense.An example front garden Massey suggests is a low-maintenance gravel garden with plants that are resistant to drought and wind, as front gardens are often more exposed to the elements, with lower-quality soil. Suggested plants include the small-flowered hesperaloe, a yucca-like perennial with pink flowers, and autumn sage, a bushy dwarf shrub with red, purple or yellow flowers. Both are drought-resistant, low-effort and attractive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

Three modern wind turbines could produce as much power as the whole [Hagshaw] site,” he said.“Although Hagshaw is our oldest site, there were a number of windfarms built in the late 1990s which are coming to the end of their operational lives. We have a dozen more to repower over the next three or four years.”The local community had been “really supportive” of the project, which would employ up to 100 people when work reached its peak, he said.Currently, repowering an existing windfarm is subject to the same planning consent process as building a new onshore windfarm from scratch, according to Jordan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The team wants to work out why the “mysterious” and “intriguing” garden bug has its fin, and discover more about its lifecycle as well as which plants may host it.Giant willow aphids are regularly seen from July to February, with a peak in sightings in autumn. As the name may suggest, they are found on willow in particular, but the RHS wants to know if they are found on other plants, and especially if they are seen between February and the end of May.Seaweed compost and bean ‘manure’ among RHS garden trends for 2023Read moreThe insects are easy to see with the naked eye but sometimes retreat into crevices in bark to hide from predators. They are usually seen on the stems and branches of trees, and do not cause unsightly damage to host plants, which can withstand the delicate feeding from these insects.In May 2022, colonies were found on a quince tree (Cydonia oblonga) in Hertfordshire, a new host for this aphid. They had previously mainly been found on willow and occasionally on other trees including apple and poplar. Dr Andrew Salisbury, RHS principal entomologist, said: “The sighting of giant willow aphids on quince, a previously unrecorded host, at a time of year when they are rarely seen, only raises more questions about this fascinating and sometimes elusive aphid.“Despite thorough research, it isn’t certain where they go from April to June, and their host range needs more investigation. We are asking gardeners for their help tracking this aphid down to help answer these intriguing questions about this unusual species.”Gardeners are being used more than ever in science experiments as an untapped resource.

It follows three back-to-back La Niña events, which are associated with higher rainfall and lower temperatures in eastern Australia.The next El Niño: when is it coming and how strong might this one be for Australia?Read moreThe bureau had previously described Australia as being on “El Niño watch”. It said the change did not alter an existing forecast that there would be drier and warmer conditions across much of Australia this winter.It said sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean were at least 0.8C above the long-term average – a key threshold for an El Niño to form. Seven international climate models surveyed by the bureau, including its own, suggested sea surface temperatures would continue to rise in the region in coming months. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Dr Tom Mortlock, a senior analyst at Aon and adjunct fellow at UNSW’s Climate Change Research Centre, said following the end of autumn “we can now be much more confident in El Niño model forecasts”.“We know from the historical record that bushfire events are more likely during periods of El Niño, whereas floods and cyclones are less likely, but can still happen,” he said. “The concern now is that, with the long absence of El Niño and back to back La Niñas, the landscape is preconditioned for bushfire with significant fuel growth occurring.”The bureau said all models suggested another climate driver, the Indian Ocean Dipole, may move into a positive phrase in winter. If so, this would typically further suppress winter and spring rain across much of Australia, and could exacerbate an El Niño’s drying effect.",

In a European Respiratory Journal editorial, they said: “We need to do all we can to help alleviate patients’ suffering.”They added that the impact of the climate emergency and human health had become interlinked and was now “irreversible”. An increase in pollen and other allergens as well as wildfires, dust storms and fossil fuel-based traffic all worsen existing respiratory conditions or can create new ones, the authors wrote in the peer-reviewed paper.Air pollution is estimated to have killed 6.7 million people globally in 2019 and 373,000 in Europe, with greenhouse gases and air pollution sharing many of the same sources.“Climate change affects everyone’s health, but arguably, respiratory patients are among the most vulnerable,” said Zorana Jovanovic Andersen, a professor of environmental epidemiology at the University of Copenhagen and an author of the report. “These are people who already experience breathing difficulties and they are far more sensitive to our changing climate. Their symptoms will become worse, and for some this will be fatal.”Children are more affected by the climate crisis and air pollution because their lungs are still developing, they breathe faster and they inhale two to three times more air than adults while spending more time outdoors.Exposure to air pollution early in life could make it more likely that people develop chronic lung diseases later on, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchitis from smoking, the authors said.Cutting greenhouse gas emissions and stopping the planet from further heating would lead to “substantially larger and more immediate benefits”, the authors wrote, as people’s health would swiftly improve as air becomes cleaner.Jovanovic Andersen added: “We all need to breathe clean, safe air. That means we need action from policymakers to mitigate impacts of climate change on our planet and our health.",

Their work began in 2018 after they arrived at the Ximenes settlement, in the municipality of Barreiros in Pernambuco state in north-eastern Brazil. They had been displaced from their homes because of the expansion of the Suape port area farther north.The new settlement provided by the government is surrounded by a huge sugar cane plantation. The soil is unproductive, and pesticides threaten the native bees. There are no paved roads, schools or health centres in the area. Housing is precarious and the area is often flooded by the river.With few options for planting, the women turned to the local university to learn how to keep bees. Prof Renata Valéria Gomes, from the zootechnics department at the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, provided the protective suits and hives and taught them beekeeping techniques to produce quality honey, free of pesticides. Until then beekeeping in the municipality was exclusively undertaken by men.Added to the financial independence they got by selling honey, the women pushed for a new sustainable dynamic in the community. To attract more bees, they began to plant crops around their homes using techniques passed down by their ancestors, transforming their back yards into oases with flowers, trees and crops. They combine genetic improvement techniques with ancestral knowledge to find sustainable ways of producing honey.I photographed this project in 2021, during the pandemic, and by watching these women who improved their lives by taking care of bees and also their surroundings, I was encouraged to think about a future with other possibilities, in which we don’t have to destroy to survive.I felt some kind of hope, not an innocent hope that just waits for better days, but a kind of hope that shows us that we already have within our reach, the tools and resources to establish cooperative projects that are in tune with the rhythms of nature and life itself.",

However, fossil fuels have been receiving greater additional investment recently. From 2020 to 2021 they received an extra £1bn support from the government compared with 2020, a 10.7% increase. For renewable energy in the same year, total support for projects increased by just £1m, or 0.01%.Analysis by the House of Commons library found that a fifth of the money given directly to the fossil fuel industry was to support new extraction and mining. In 2021, support for fossil fuel extraction rose by 20% to nearly £2bn.Politicians have asked the government to put net zero at the heart of policy decisions instead of funding fossil fuel corporations.Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat climate and energy spokesperson, said: “It is extremely alarming that the Conservative government has been giving these staggering amounts to the fossil fuel industry. Not only have the Conservatives failed to properly tax the record profits of the oil and gas giants, they have showered these companies with taxpayer money too.“We have been through one of the toughest winters on record and the energy crisis is still biting hard. The government squandered the opportunity to shield us from these spiralling energy bills through their lack of long-term thinking. For years, they gave billions to the fossil fuel industry, rather than actually improving our energy security by investing properly in renewables.“This is just yet more proof of the government’s legacy of failure on climate change.

Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesLast week, Sunak said the 2030 deadline on the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles would be pushed back to 2035, and the boiler phase-out by 2035 would be weakened. These moves are likely to raise the UK’s emissions in the next decade, but Sunak did not set out whether or how that would be offset by cuts elsewhere.The government’s previous plans to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and on phasing out gas boilers, were key parts of the UK’s submissions under the Paris climate agreement. Plans known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are fundamental to the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change.At the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021, Sharma fought to secure global agreement that NDCs should be updated frequently and should represent a strengthening of targets, to prevent any weakening or backsliding. At the Cop27 summit in Egypt, he spoke out sharply to rebuke countries that wanted to renege on previous commitments.Sam Hunter Jones, lawyer at ClientEarth, a campaigning group, said: “Rolling back on existing policies risks going against a Paris agreement cornerstone of increased ambition, just months before Cop28 negotiations.

It was evidence Australia had become “the complacent country” on the issue despite the experience of last summer’s catastrophic bushfires, he said.“Besides the United States under [Donald] Trump and Brazil under [Jair] Bolsonaro, we in Australia are the only major economy that does not take the need for action on climate change seriously. Nor do we recognise the economic opportunities that will come with that action. I would argue this is bad company to keep,” Rudd said as part of his keynote address at the Wilson Dialogue.“I fear that seeking to untangle our carbon-intensive economy much later than the rest of the world could in fact be what causes the next recession in Australia as the global economy increasingly walks away from fossil fuel dependency.”'Culture of fear': why Kevin Rudd is determined to see an end to Murdoch's media dominanceRead moreRudd said his vision for a green recovery from the pandemic included large-scale investment in renewable energy to position as a clean energy superpower, saying there was evidence it could create “new jobs, new industries, new wealth” while providing clean energy at home and creating clean energy technology that could be exported.He said it should include investments in projects such as the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, which proposes a massive green hydrogen development in the Pilbara, and contrasted clean energy opportunities with what he said was the government’s obsession with a “gas-led recovery”.",

Insurers on the Lloyd’s market are collectively the world’s biggest fossil fuel underwriters, with an estimated $1.6bn to $2.2bn in annual premiums, it found. Among the biggest Lloyd’s names are Hiscox and Beazley.The Top 10 individual insurers of fossil fuel projects are the Lloyd’s insurer Aegis, the People’s Insurance Company of China, Russia’s Sogaz, Germany’s Allianz, France’s Axa, Canada’s Fairfax Financial, Switzerland’s Zurich and the US insurers Chubb, W.R. Berkley and AIG.With floods, hurricanes, wildfires and droughts increasing in frequency and severity, insurance payouts for natural catastrophes have jumped to an average $110bn a year since 2017, more than twice the average over the previous five years, according to industry figures from Swiss Re.Despite this, Insure Our Future said most insurers continued to support projects to boost oil and gas production, even though they were incompatible with the 1.5C Paris climate target.Peter Bosshard, global coordinator of the campaign, said: “Most insurance companies continue to ensure new oil and gas projects – pipelines, [liquefied natural gas] terminals and gas-fired power plants – which will lock in demand for decades to come – at a time when the climate crisis is escalating and when insurance companies are withdrawing from many regions because they consider the climate risks too high.”Some companies have stopped insuring homes in California, Florida and Louisiana, and in parts of Australia, leaving homeowners highly vulnerable and with significantly reduced property values.The report found that restrictions on oil and gas are far weaker than on coal.

He told the BBC: “These conditions are not normally good for angling.“We’re so early in the year – we’re early summer – and already twice this year the River Ness has got to its lowest level at that particular time of year on record.”He said there was a huge amount of concern about the health of the river.The loch dropped to its lowest level since records began in 1990 last month and it is categorised as being “low”.Dry weather in recent weeks has led to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) issuing a water scarcity alert in parts of the country.There are also claims that hydroelectric power schemes are affecting the water levels at Loch Ness, which by volume is the largest body of water in the UK. Shaw said pumped storage hydro near Foyers was contributing to the low water levels.Adrian Shine, a naturalist who has studied the loch for decades and designed the Loch Ness Exhibition, also noted the low levels.

On the contrary, we believe that the impacts and risks are too high for this possibility to be ruled out,” they write.The team say that it is unlikely that bodies contributing to light pollution – be it from ground-based LEDs or other lamps, or low-altitude satellites – will regulate themselves.“Every time some health or environmental issue arises and starts to be addressed in the scientific literature, the ‘machine of doubt’ is put into action by the polluters to stop, or at least delay by years or decades, the adoption of countermeasures and rules to protect human health and the environment,” write Fabio Falchi, from the Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute in Italy, and co-authors in a comment piece.Light pollution rapidly reducing number of stars visible to naked eye, study findsRead moreAs a result, the team have called for action.“In my opinion there should be a cap limit on the total number of satellites in low orbits, and their number is probably already too high,” Falchi said, with the team writing that caps should also be introduced for artificial light at night.According to an accompanying perspective piece, megaconstellations have more than doubled the number of functional satellites in low Earth orbit since early 2019, with a vast number of launches planned in the coming years.But experts say this has come at a cost: the illumination of the artificial satellites and associated space junk by the sun has increased night sky brightness.",

Industry elites heard dire warnings from their own scientists who predicted the urgency of the climate crisis nearly 60 years ago. But instead of taking swift action, the oil conglomerates staged a coordinated disinformation campaign to suppress political action and public awareness around the growing scientific consensus pointing to a climate emergency.Now, the lawsuits conclude, fossil fuel companies should pay for the damage they have helped to cause to the planet.The Guardian’s new series, Climate crimes, launched in collaboration with the global media consortium Covering Climate Now, will examine these attempts to hold the industry accountable and investigate the tactics used by the companies to elide their own role in global heating. It will also interrogate the central question that emerges from these lawsuits: is the climate crisis in fact a crime scene? Much of the content produced for the series will be made available for Covering Climate Now’s 400-plus partner news outlets to publish.There is a good reason to think we will know more soon. The legal process for the roughly two dozen climate change lawsuits currently pending in the US is likely to reveal more damning information that could further detail the extent of the oil industry’s deceptions. Investigative reporting has already revealed that the companies undertook their own climate change research decades ago – in 1979, for instance, an Exxon study said that burning fossil fuels “will cause dramatic environmental effects” in the coming decades, and concluded that “the potential problem is great and urgent.” By copying the playbook utilized by big tobacco, the firms were able to sow doubt about the existence of the problem that persists to this day.",

The fundamental problem that we have right now in the market, which is both preventing it from being a force for good and preventing it from scaling to a level that matters for the climate, is that it’s very hard to tell the difference,” he said.“The role of the integrity councils is to say what good looks like and we’re going to let the chips fall where they may. We are going to do it in a way that listens to all stakeholders and takes into account feasibility, but we are going to come out with what high integrity looks like,” said Keohane.",

Rostam Batmanglij, formerly of Vampire Weekend and now an acclaimed solo artist, hailed the scheme as “an intelligent use of the income our intellectual property generates”.Other musicians joining the scheme include Anna Calvi, Mount Kimbie, Erland Cooper and Aurora. Aurora said: “I am currently writing my next album – it’s an album about interconnectedness and the art of coexistence. There is no greater teacher than Mother Earth. There is no greater home, or provider. There is no better place than Earth. And that is why I want to make this whole album with Mother Earth as a co-writer, because without her there wouldn’t be any such thing as music.”The scheme is part of EarthPercent’s broader mission to divert revenue from the music industry towards environmental causes. The charity hopes to raise $100m by 2030, saying that money will be spent on ways to reduce the environmental impact of the music industry, as well as restoring nature, advancing policy change and securing “climate justice and fair environmental stewardship”.Bands such as folk-rockers Big Thief have pledged to donate 1% of touring revenue to the charity, to help offset their environmental impact.Tours, particularly international ones by arena and stadium-level artists which involve transporting vast teams and heavy staging, generate hundreds of thousands of tonnes of CO2 emissions each year. The manufacturing of vinyl and merchandise has its own impact, and individual artists such as Drake and Travis Scott have been criticised for their frequent use of private jets.",

Previous dingo testing, in comparison, generally only looked at 23 DNA markers.Fewer animals were tested than in a 2021 study Cairns co-authored, which analysed more than 5000 samples using the older method. In the new study, Cairns had results for 112 animals using both DNA testing methods.Cairns said the comparison showed “the old method of DNA testing wasn’t very reliable.“It was assuming that there was just one type of dingo, and that therefore any differences between dingoes across the country was because of hybridisation – when we found it’s actually because there are different types of dingoes.",

Originating in Asia, it incurs huge clean-up costs near roads, railways, buildings and other publicly accessible land.Japanese knotweed, introduced in the mid-19th century as an ornamental garden plant, is the next most expensive, costing about £246.5m as it colonises roadsides, riverbanks and derelict land. It is known to cause damage to lightweight structures such as conservatories, garages and boundary walls, which can be expensive to rectify and decrease the value of properties substantially.Overall, annual estimated costs in 2021 associated with Inns were £3bn for England, £499m for Scotland, £343m for Wales and £150m for Northern Ireland, according to the research carried out by the international scientific organisation Cabi.The species include rabbits, beloved as a pet but hated as a pest, introduced to Britain by the Romans about 2,000 years go. They can destroy agricultural areas by overgrazing, while burrowing affects the quality of pastures, meaning rabbits cost an estimated £170m. Rats and mice (£84m), cockroaches (£69m) and non-native deer (£62m) are among other costly species.The cost to forestry from Inns has increased eightfold since the previous report in 2010 and is now estimated at £123m, while in agriculture, the most affected industry, they cost the UK economy about £1.1bn. Their impact on construction, development and infrastructure was £270m, and on tourism and recreation it was £136m, the scientists said.Dr Richard Shaw, a Cabi co-author of the research, which was published in the journal Biological Invasions, said: “This assessment again shows the important costs of Inns to the UK economy.",

The report’s authors warn that humans are destroying one of the most effective tools for mitigating global heating and halting biodiversity loss.Land use change is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions behind the burning of fossil fuels and is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels is unlikely without stopping the destruction of rainforests, according to scientists.Graphic showing loss of tree cover in South America, 2002 to 2022At Cop26 in 2021, more than 100 world leaders, including Joe Biden, Xi Jinping and Jair Bolsonaro, signed up to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 in a commitment that covered more than 90% of the world’s forests. The new data suggests that leaders are failing to deliver on their promise.Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Bolivia headed the table for tropical primary forest loss in 2022. Indonesia and Malaysia managed to keep rates of loss near record low levels after significant corporate and government action in recent years. Bolivia was one of the few big forested countries that did not sign the Cop26 commitment on stopping the loss.Ghana, a major producer of cacao for chocolate, has suffered the biggest relative increase in forest loss of any country in recent years, although the absolute figures are small.Away from the tropics, the loss of Russia’s boreal forests slowed after a record year for destruction in 2021, but researchers said this was not an indication of a positive trend.",

But Cael’s team pored over 20 years of observations by Nasa’s Modis-Aqua satellite, an exhaustive data repository, and looked for patterns of change in the ocean’s hue through a fuller colour spectrum including red and blue.Plankton of different sizes scatter light differently, and plankton with different pigments absorb light differently. Examining changes in colour can give scientists a clearer picture of changes in plankton populations around the globe. Phytoplankton is crucial to ocean ecosystems because it is at the base of most of its food chains.When comparing these changes in colour with those hypothesised from a computer model simulating what the oceans would look like if human-caused global heating had never taken place, the change was clear.“We do have changes in the colour that are significantly emerging in almost all of the ocean of the tropics or subtropics,” said Cael.The changes have been detected over 56% of the world’s oceans – an area greater than all of the land on Earth.In most areas there’s a clear “greening effect”, Cael said, but he added that there are also places where red or blue colourings are rising or falling.“These are not ultra, massive ecosystem-destroying changes, they may be subtle,” said Cael. “But this gives us an additional piece of evidence that human activity is likely affecting large parts of the global biosphere in a way that we haven’t been able to understand.",

Payne identified the haunting tones as songs whales sing to one another.The sound ecologist capturing a disappearing world: ‘70% of habitats I recorded are gone’Read moreHe saw the discovery of whale song as a chance to spur interest in saving the giant animals, who were disappearing from the planet. Payne would produce the album Songs of the Humpback Whale in 1970. A surprise hit, the record galvanized a global movement to end the practice of commercial whale hunting and save the cetaceans from extinction. It remains the best-selling environmental album in history.Payne was conscious from the start that whale song represented a chance to get the public interested in protecting an animal previously considered little more than a resource, curiosity or nuisance.Payne died on Saturday of pelvic cancer. He lived in South Woodstock, Vermont, with his wife, the actor Lisa Harrow. Payne was born in New York City and educated at Harvard University and Cornell University.Payne had four children from a previous marriage to zoologist Katy Payne, with whom he collaborated. The two used primitive equipment in the late 1960s to record the sounds of humpback whales, which sometimes sing their eerie, complex songs for longer than a half hour at a stretch.The impact of the whale song discovery on the nascent environmental movement was immense. Many anti-war protesters of the day took on saving animals and the environment as a new cause, and the words “save the whales” became ubiquitous on tote bags and bumper stickers.Researchers have long debated how humpbacks use song, but there is broad agreement that they are sexual signals that male humpback whales use in an attempt to increase their mating opportunities.“It took time for me to notice, because while the whales do repeat themselves, several minutes often pass before the same stanza comes around again. Also, there are no breaks in their songs.",

They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver conditions, immune disorders, birth defects and other serious health problems.PFAS pollution from a Chemours plant in North Carolina has widely contaminated the soil, water and air for hundreds of square miles around the company’s Fayetteville Works plant, and residents say their exposure to the chemicals is behind elevated cancer levels and other serious health problems.Last year, a team led by Belcher found alligators in the region exposed to high levels of PFAS in the Cape Fear River exhibited signs of disease similar to lupus.Residents have also said they suspect their pets have gotten sick from exposure to the chemicals. Among them is Adrian Stokes, who last year told the Guardian he has watched helplessly as he, his cats and his dogs seemed to suffer from similar ailments.One cat repeatedly fell face-first into her food, he said, and another wobbled while it walked, which a vet attributed to unexplained kidney and neurological disorders. Two of his dogs had to drag themselves after losing use of their back legs, and Stokes put them to sleep.A few miles away, Fayetteville resident Mike Watters’ three huskies died of pancreatic cancer, while area livestock owners have said they cannot find any other explanation as to why their horses have developed similar respiratory issues, and cattle were born deformed.The study was partly organized by concerned local residents and funded through the state.",

Paintings by Lowry, Constable, Monet and Turner show how our skies were often filled with haze and smoke, but we have few measurements to understand how much pollution was in the air and what it was made of.Dr Ann Power, of the University of Exeter, has been looking for evidence of past air pollution in the mud of urban and agricultural ponds. “We wanted to understand how exposure to urban air pollution has changed over the last 200 years as our towns and cities have evolved since the Industrial Revolution. We focused on the Merseyside region due to its industrial past and present-day high rates of long-term illness,” she said.Investigations of historical air pollution often involve considerable creativity. Previous studies have tracked air pollution through the early 20th century by examining the soot-stained feathers of stuffed birds from museum collections, and others have used 18th-century measurements of the electrical properties of the atmosphere made by amateur weather enthusiasts.In her research, Power paddled a small inflatable boat around ornamental and agricultural ponds in Merseyside. All were present in maps from the 1800s. The largest was less than half the size of a football pitch, and the smallest were less than a few metres across. She used ropes to tether her boat in the middle of each pond and carefully leaned over the side to drill into the sediment.Individual ponds told the story of the air pollution around them, but many trends were common across the whole region. Lead was found in the pond muds. This increased rapidly from the 1970 sediment until lead additives in petrol were controlled and finally banned in the late 1990s.Sulphur in the pond mud declined from the 1970s, reflecting the slow rollout of smoke control areas, the availability of fossil gas to replace coal and progressive controls on industry. Zinc and copper could be matched to the opening of foundries and the modern expansion of vehicle manufacturing. Fly ash particles reflected the operations of former coal-fired power stations, including those at Bold and Fiddlers Ferry.",

Before we moved to the country, we lived in Greenwich, south-east London, and we used to get a bit ginned-up and very excited about things. I remember it being quite close to my birthday in March; we were watching some David Attenborough thing on TV. They had a decorator crab on, which creates a camouflage by encrusting itself with whatever it finds around it, making it near invisible. I fell in love with the whole concept and remember waxing lyrical about dropping beads, sequins and diamonds into a tank so that a decorator crab could use them.Obviously, I was extraordinarily, grandiloquently overenthusiastic and my wife was so desperate to grant my wish that she did indeed buy me a decorator crab for my birthday, at considerable inconvenience and, I would imagine, expense. Of course, the problem with a decorator crab is that you can’t just buy it a little bed and a lead; you need a whole ecosystem. Basically, we ended up with a coral reef in our kitchen.We called him Caligula – although I don’t think it really suited him. You always think of Caligula as being incredibly spoilt and petulant, but there was something stoical about my crab. We then had a spending frenzy that resulted in us acquiring as many colour-coordinated fish as we could get. Of course, picking fish based purely on the Pantone colour chart meant we had quite a few disasters. “Oh my God, I found a fish in the perfect shade of magenta!” It would turn out to be incredibly poisonous to all the other fish, or get eaten immediately by something bigger.‘I imagined the world would see it as my greatest work’ … Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen at home.

In buildings, air can be contaminated with fine particles from wood burners and cooking, and with noxious gases, cancer-causing chemicals, and pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and molds, all of which contribute to health problems.Writing in the journal Nature, Whitty, Alastair Lewis, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of York, and Dr Deborah Jenkins, a specialist registrar in public health at the Department of Health, call for a scientific push to understand indoor air pollution, with the aim of producing a “roadmap to cleaner indoor air.”“Indoor air pollution hasn’t received the same attention [as outdoor air], even though it might cause almost as many deaths globally,” the authors write. The lack of research makes it hard for governments to target policies and controls, while building owners may be oblivious to the health risks and how to reduce them, they add.Most people in industrialised countries spend 80-90% of their time indoors, in homes and offices or public spaces such as schools, shops, hospitals and transport hubs. But while indoor air contains a wider range of pollutants than outdoor air, reliable information on sources, concentrations, the harm they cause and ways to make buildings healthier beyond better ventilation is lacking.The risks are shifting all the time. In England, coal burning, cigarette smoking, chemicals from paints, and nitrogen oxides from gas have all fallen in recent years. But volatile organic compounds from cosmetics and personal care products have risen, as have particulates due to the popularity of wood burners.",

In all three cases – South West Water, Thames Water and Yorkshire Water – acceptance of any bonus at all would rightly have provoked general outrage. These firms were at, or near to, the bottom of the league table in the Environment Agency’s last set of annual environmental performance ratings.At the most sludgy end, South West joined Southern in scoring the lowest possible one star out of four, which the chair of the EA – a body that itself has hardly excelled during three decades of under-regulation – translated into plain English: it meant the companies’ environmental performance “was terrible across the board”. Thames and Yorkshire were two of four companies getting two stars, which indicated a need for “significant improvement”, so still deeply in cruddy territory.It is conceivable, of course, that the trio have upped their game and undergone a transformation since the EA published its ratings for 2021 last July. But, even if they have (don’t hold your breath until this July), the timing doesn’t work bonus-wise for the 2022-23 financial year. Improvement has to be seen to have happened – and then to be achieved regularly to remove weather-related vagaries.Given the star ratings, many may wonder if Sarah Bentley at Thames, Susan Davy at Pennon (owner of South West) and Nicola Shaw at Yorkshire are volunteering to forego bonuses they wouldn’t have received anyway. The answer – strange as it sounds – is that, actually, they are probably surrendering a few hundred thousand pounds or so each.Sarah Bentley, chief executive of Thames Water, has waived her bonus. Photograph: Thames WaterIn common with the set-up across the entire UK quoted-company scene, the formula for awarding bonuses tends to include so many metrics that it is hard for a chief executive to be awarded zilch. Aside from financial targets, the service-related metrics themselves contain a dashboard of dials.

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Electricity futures prices saw steep falls in the mainland states through to the end of the quarter” after the price limits were imposed on 9 December, said Violette Mouchaileh, an AEMO executive.The average price of $93/megawatt-hour across the national electricity market (NEM) that serves eastern Australia was less than half the $216/MWh cost in the September quarter. Still, it was almost 80% higher than for the final three months of 2021.Household solar boom back on track after severe weather and supply disruptions lead to 14% drop in capacityRead moreRenewable energy from wind, solar and hydro supplied an average of 40.3% of power in the NEM, a record for any quarter since the NEM started in 1998.It exceeded the previous high, set a year earlier, of 35.8%, AEMO said.The tail end of the third La Niña event in as many years trimmed power demand for daytime air-conditioning.A 16% increase in electricity output from rooftop solar panels, or 410MW on average, also decreased demand from the grid.As a result, operational demand fell 2% from a year earlier to an average 19,431MW, the lowest December quarter reading. New record lows for a quarter were set in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, while the 11,892MW use on 6 November was a new low for the NEM in the December quarter.The government hailed the early signs of a retreat in wholesale power prices as early proof that its price caps were having an effect on household bills.

Vast areas of this unexplored abyss, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, are littered with polymetallic nodules, rich in manganese, nickel, copper, cobalt and other trace minerals. Minerals are also found near hydrothermal vents and within seamounts (underwater mountains).Why is there a growing interest in deep-sea mining?The race to cut carbon emissions to combat global heating has led to a soaring demand for copper, cobalt, nickel and other ingredients needed for the energy transition. In 2040, the world’s need for many of these metals, used for electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, will be twice what it is today, according to the International Energy Agency.Demand for copper, for instance, is expected to double, from 25m tonnes in 2020, to 50m by 2050. Supporters of deep sea mining argue that a huge expansion of mining on land would cause further environmental havoc: mining the sea floor is less destructive, they say. Critics say land mining will carry on and that deep sea mining will cause “irreversible harm” to marine life and systems.What are the potential environmental impacts?Scientists have warned of large-scale, severe and irreversible harm to global ocean ecosystems, already threatened by the climate and biodiversity crises, if deep-sea mining goes ahead. In July, a team of scientists found 5,000 new species in the deep-sea bed, most unknown to science, living in a mineral-rich area of the Pacific Ocean, known as the Clarion-Clipperton zone, targeted by deep-sea mining firms.Studies have shown that mining below 200 metres can cause harmful noise, vibration, sediment plumes and light pollution. A recent study looking at drilling tests in Japan, showed animal populations decrease where mining occurs and it leaves a wider footprint than previously thought. There is also the risk of leaks and spills of fuel and other chemicals used.Which countries oppose or support deep-sea mining?Last year, the UK, Sweden and Ireland joined countries calling for a moratorium, pause or ban on commercial deep-sea mining.",

How the rare palm – named Pinanga subterranea – has survived is a mystery, as most plants have evolved to develop their flowers and fruit above ground to facilitate pollination and the dispersal of seeds.“Pinanga subterranea is the only known species of palm to flower and fruit below ground,” said Dr Benedikt Kuhnhäuser, a future leader fellow at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, who was part of the research team that collected specimens and ascertained that it was a new species. “Flowering and fruiting below ground is mind-boggling and seemingly paradoxical because they appear to prevent pollination and dispersal. We now know bearded pigs eat and disperse Pinanga subterranea’s fruits, but we’ve yet to find out how and by whom the flowers are pollinated.”Only a very small number of plant species have evolved to flower or fruit underground. But only one other plant is thought to do both. Exclusive flowering and fruiting below ground, as discovered in Pinanga subterranea, is incredibly rare,” said Kuhnhäuser. “We’re only aware of one other plant that does that: the small underground orchid genus rhizanthella.”The fruits of Pinanga subterranea are eaten and dispersed by bearded pigs but the means of fertilisation are unclear. Photograph: Royal Botanical Gardens, KewKew’s research team were first alerted to the plant’s presence by Dr Paul Chai, a Malaysian botanist, who encountered the palm in 1997 during a visit to Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary in Sarawak. As well as studying the plants, Kew’s team reviewed extensive reference collections of palms in botanical institutions in Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as at Kew. “Pinanga subterranea has separate male and female flowers in little clusters,” said Kuhnhäuser. “So far, we’ve only seen the female flowers, which are greenish-white and inconspicuous. The fruit is pale white when young, but bright red when ripe and up to two centimetres in size.”Native to the tropical island of Borneo in south-east Asia, the one-of-a-kind palm was also found in Kalimantan in Indonesia.",

Electricity prices are linked to wholesale gas costs, which have risen sharply since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Will Gardiner, the chief executive, said: “Drax delivered a strong performance in 2022, and played a significant role in ensuring security of supply during a challenging year for the UK’s energy system.”Drax, which supplies up to 6% of the UK’s electricity, and is seen as a source of when weather conditions preclude significant wind and solar power generation.Climate campaigners have accused Drax of greenwashing, arguing its biomass operations, which burn wood pellets to produce electricity, are far from green and can even increase the CO2 emissions driving the climate crisis.Most of the wood is imported from North America. The former energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng called its business model “not sustainable”.Drax was the subject of a BBC Panorama investigation over alleged forest destruction and has also been accused of “environmental racism”.The power company said it had earned £837m in subsidies in 2020 and £885m in 2021. The level of support fell to £617m in 2022 as electricity prices exceed an agreed “strike price” agreed to encourage renewable investment.This meant Drax paid out £33m to the Low Carbon Contracts Company, a government-owned firm, compared with receiving £231m under the same mechanism a year earlier. However, it still received £650m under an older renewable energy scheme.The thinktank Ember has estimated that, from 2012 until 2027, when the support runs out, Drax would have collected more than £11bn in subsidies.The Conservative MP Pauline Latham said: “The government pays significant sums in renewable energy subsidies to bioenergy companies making sizeable profits, despite it releasing huge amounts of greenhouse gases and harming forests’ ability to absorb carbon.",

These include the Australian Industry Group, the Investor Group on Climate Change and the Australian Conservation Foundation. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Last week the Greens called for a national energy transition authority in a Senate inquiry backing their private senator’s bill. The move was rejected by Labor senators on the basis it would duplicate the work of existing agencies.The ACTU, with its 38 affiliated unions and 1.8 million workers, has much greater institutional sway within Labor. The call for an energy transition authority is backed by the mining union and the Electrical Trades Union, both affiliates of the Labor party.According to excerpts of her speech, O’Neil says the authority would “support the workers at fossil fuel facilities that will phase down in the transition to a net zero carbon future”.“That means individualised labour adjustment packages to guarantee workers affected by the transition have access to quality, secure, and safe jobs,” she says.“These should include industrywide pooled redundancy and redeployment schemes, education and training opportunities, income replacement and relocation packages where necessary, and early retirement packages where voluntary and appropriate.”Australia’s white paper industry is dead, leaving rural communities to pick through the pulpRead moreAccording to O’Neil, the government has “concluded rightly that it can’t just rely on high carbon industries to reduce their emissions at the pace required by climate science … That is why we needed legislation”.“Likewise, we cannot rely on these industries to simply do the right thing by their workers when a facility is closing down.",

Because they cannot usually be recycled, the majority are disposed of in landfill or by incineration.The lead author, Siswanti Zuraida, and colleagues prepared concrete and mortar samples by combining washed, dried, and shredded disposable nappy waste with cement, sand, gravel, and water, curing the samples for 28 days. They then tested six samples containing different proportions of waste to measure how much pressure they could withstand without breaking. They then calculated the maximum proportion of sand that could be replaced with disposable nappies in a range of building materials.The researchers found concrete made with nappies was as good as conventional materials. They said: “The research also demonstrated that the mechanical properties and microbial content of disposable diaper concrete, in specific compositions, are identical to conventional concrete. Adding 1% diaper to concrete enhances internal curing hydration and produces the most robust, durable material. In addition, a mixture of up to 5% disposable diapers with concrete had the maximum strength at 28 days compared to other percentages.”The scientists said it was unlikely the use of nappies in the mixture would have any negative effects on health, as sodium chloride could be used to sanitise them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

The first products will be available from the end of August in the UK, EU and US.The price has yet to be set and the company will gather customer feedback from the first batches to tweak the product’s recipe, name and packaging before the full launch. The cost will be higher than regular ribs, which are generally a cheap meat product.Makers of plant-based meat are continuing to innovate, but some big companies in the sector have had a slump in sales as the cost of living crisis pushes shoppers towards cheaper regular meat.Cutting traditional meat consumption in rich nations, where people already eat more red meat than is healthy, is vital to tackling the climate crisis. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are dominated by those from livestock, particularly cattle, which make up 15% of all global emissions.Plants cause far lower emissions. Cutting meat and dairy consumption also slashes pollution, and land and water use, with scientists saying it is the single biggest way for people to reduce their impact on the planet.“To some, bones from plants may be an ideological provocation, but we shouldn’t take these things too seriously,” said Vladimir Mićković, co-founder of Juicy Marbles, which is based in Slovenia. “It’s just fun. Bones invite you to eat with your hands and share [food] with the whole table.”The first batch of the soya-based ribs will go on sale in late August. Photograph: Juicy Marbles“There is a culture of celebration, sharing, and belonging around meat [and] anyone cutting down on meat can feel excluded from cultural traditions,” he said. “That’s why we chose ribs as our next product.” The company started selling a marbled plant-based steak and a tenderloin in 2022.The bones, which have the same amount of protein as beef jerky, need to be baked or fried to produce a crispy snack, after the plant-based meat has been eaten.",

They say buds suggest trees will be floriferous with blossom this spring because of the perfect conditions last year for bud formation, and also because early flowering has been prevented by the cold this February.This means the blooming season will be potentially longer lasting. Hopefully the risk of them being “got at” by frost will lessen as the season progresses, and there will be more fruit as a direct result later in the year.Guy Barter, the chief horticulturist at the RHS, said: “Spring blossom is special each year but this year the light and heat of last summer has promoted a very promising crop of flower buds indeed. These buds had plenty of cold this winter, which they require (officially called the chill factor expressed in hours at about 6C) to ‘release’ them to flower once spring warms up.“Ornamental cherries, arguably the best of all flowering trees, tough out any spring frosts and are reliably glorious. Apples and other fruit blossom, however, are very vulnerable to late frosts. This cold February means fruit trees won’t flower early. This is good as it means they are more likely to escape any late spring frost that can prevent fruit forming.”Some were concerned the intense heat and drought of last year could have weakened the trees, but they managed to weather it well, perhaps because of their deeper roots. The trees also benefited from extra warmth and light. Other plants with more shallow roots were not so lucky, and some trees, including apple trees, did not have enough “chilling hours” in the early winter, because it was mild in September and October, to produce good fruit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

It was going to be incinerated in the atmosphere at the start of this year. Now, after an appeal from forest experts, Nasa has changed its mind and extended the life of the mission.The sensor, roughly the size of a fridge, was put into storage last week in the International Space Station while another project completes its mission over the next 18 months. Survival heaters are being deployed to make sure critical components do not get damaged in the cold.It is understood that the sensor will be reinstalled and could last until the ISS is decommissioned in 2031, giving scientists more data on issues including how much carbon trees store and the effect of forest fires on the atmosphere.Researchers overseeing the project, based at the University of Maryland, said Gedi would have the chance to finish its work and calibrate its results with other satellites due to launch this decade that will monitor the planet’s ecosystems.“The outpouring of support we received for keeping the mission alive was incredible,” said Prof Ralph Dubayah, principal investigator on the mission. “Gedi has made over 20bn observations of the 3D structure of forests, over temperate and tropical forests. This data is helping to address longstanding issues on the role of forests in the carbon cycle – what impact has deforestation and degradation had on atmospheric CO2 concentrations?“The mission’s return in the 2025 timeframe is spot-on for further reporting on the Paris accords.",

One of the rules is that debt has to be falling as a percentage of GDP.“I’m confident. We’re talking about where we might be in 2027. So being a careful and cautious former lawyer, I know that the world can change. Four or five years ago, we didn’t know we were going to hit Covid or Ukraine. I’m confident that we can get to that figure [but] in the end, the fiscal rule comes first.”Labour’s energy advisers warn against watering down £28bn green investmentRead moreAsked by LBC’s Nick Ferrari whether the figure was a pledge or a “gold-plated ambition”, Starmer said: “It’s a confident ambition.”The Labour leader has put green investment at the heart of his policy pitch to voters, promising to decarbonise Britain’s power sector by 2030. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, announced in 2021 that this would be achieved in part by the government spending £28bn a year until 2030 on technologies such as battery power and electric vehicles.In recent months, however, Reeves and Starmer have dialled down the ambition of the plan. Reeves announced last year a Labour government would only hit the £28bn target in the second half of a parliament, and would borrow less to avoid missing its fiscal targets.Starmer said on Thursday that the party would not borrow the full amount of money if it meant missing the debt target, but appeared to leave open the possibility he would tax more or find the money from other parts of government spending.",

It’s exactly this kind of absolutist position that has fuelled the culture wars he describes.In Dulwich, south London, closing the main road between east and west without consultation has physically and socially divided the community, damaged local shops and businesses, and increased traffic congestion on surrounding residential roads. In fact, a recent TfL report described the Dulwich LTN as the root cause of congestion on local main roads, which has in turn reduced the frequency of the local bus service on which we all depend.The Dulwich LTN has helped some, but hurt others.

This means that using them in industrial practice is prohibitively expensive because of the heating required. It also means using them is not carbon neutral.Scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute WSL have found microbes that can do this at 15C, which could lead to a breakthrough in microbial recycling. Their findings have been published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology.Dr Joel Rüthi from WSL and colleagues sampled 19 strains of bacteria and 15 of fungi growing on free-lying or intentionally buried plastic kept in the ground for one year in Greenland, Svalbard and Switzerland. They let the microbes grow as single-strain cultures in the laboratory in darkness at 15C and tested them to see if they could digest different types of plastic.The results showed that the bacterial strains belonged to 13 genera in the phyla actinobacteria and proteobacteria, and the fungi to 10 genera in the phyla ascomycota and mucoromycota.The plastics tested included non-biodegradable polyethylene (PE) and the biodegradable polyester-polyurethane (PUR) as well as two commercially available biodegradable mixtures of polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) and polylactic acid (PLA).None of the strains were able to digest PE, even after 126 days of incubation on these plastics. But 19 strains (56%), including 11 fungi and eight bacteria, were able to digest PUR at 15C, while 14 fungi and three bacteria were able to digest the plastic mixtures of PBAT and PLA.Rüthi said: “Here we show that novel microbial taxa obtained from the ‘plastisphere’ of alpine and arctic soils were able to break down biodegradable plastics at 15C. These organisms could help to reduce the costs and environmental burden of an enzymatic recycling process for plastic.”He said it was surprising that a large fraction of the tested strains were able to degrade at least one of the tested plastics.",

They tell our reporters the facts, explain the science, and warn of what is to come. But when governments and corporations still don’t act with the urgency and ambition required, it feels like words are in danger of losing their power.As journalists, this is, of course, concerning. Our role is to communicate what is happening in the world, and why it matters, in the public interest. On the climate and nature crisis, the science is clear. We are on track for a “hellish” 3C of global heating, the UN has warned ahead of the Cop28 UN climate summit that begins this week. We have to stop burning fossil fuels, and stop destroying the natural world. Yet still, we dither and delay. Another fossil fuel project is signed off. Another forest felled. More wildlife pushed to extinction.That is why at the Guardian we are committed to continuing to put our climate and nature reporting at the front and centre of everything we do. We have long pioneered this approach – giving our reporting on the living world more space, prominence and resources than any other media organisation. As well as covering the science of the escalating crisis, we also interrogate the power structures and political and corporate interests that so often stand in the way of meaningful action, and foreground the people fighting for real change.This has, in turn, inspired us to take a closer look at our own organisation: from, in 2020, no longer accepting advertising from fossil fuel companies, to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Today, we publish our first ever biodiversity audit, to measure our impact on nature and how to reduce it.The Guardian knows that the climate and nature crisis are linked, and in recent years, we have increased our coverage of catastrophic plant and wildlife loss and ecosystem collapse, with reporters dedicated to this beat.",

In an article called Jelly for Scrimpers in South Dakota magazine, Laura Johnson Andrews suggests that corn cob jelly most likely originated in about 1875, when settlers began canning jellies, pickles and preserves, including some delicious-sounding pear, cherry and peach pickles. Spent corn cobs are boiled with sugar and set with pectin to create a wildly delicious sweet jelly that is gorgeous spread on toast, pancakes or waffles. I particularly like it with cheese, especially when the jelly’s spiked with jalapeño.Because of its similarities in appearance at least, some pioneers of the plant-based world have adopted this frugal recipe as an alternative to honey, using a little less pectin to stop the syrup from setting, and to give it a honey-like viscosity. Historically, corn cob jelly has also been used in place of corn syrup, because it’s almost identical in flavour.Corn cob jelly (AKA vegan hot honey)This recipe turns a few spent corn cobs into a delicious sweet treat. It doesn’t matter if there are a few kernels left on the cobs – they will only add flavour and help turn the liquid into a glorious golden yellow. To give the appearance of honey, I’ve added a little optional turmeric, but it does impart some flavour, so add it only if you like the stuff.I strain the cob cooking liquid to create a clear, honey-like substance, but if you wish, add some corn kernels to the jelly mix before jarring, which both looks pretty and adds a wonderful texture.

In total, the birds manage 11 hours of snoozing a day – without ever slipping into uninterrupted sleep.“Humans cannot sustain this state, but penguins can,” said lead researcher Paul-Antoine Libourel from Lyon Neuroscience Research Centre. “Sleep is much more complex in its diversity than what we read about in most textbooks.”Researchers previously looked at penguin sleep in the 1980s, which involved capturing them, putting them in a shelter and watching them. They reported fragmented sleep for short periods of time, which they called “drowsiness”. In the latest research, experts found that this fragmented sleep was sustained for the whole day, showing the penguins are not “nodding off” into deeper sleep.“Sleep in breeding chinstrap penguins was highly fragmented under all conditions and positions on land,” researchers wrote in the paper, published in the journal Science. The findings suggest “microsleeps can fulfil at least some of the restorative functions of sleep”. The penguins studied could sleep standing up or lying down.Chinstrap penguins ‘sleeping’ on King George Island in Antarctica. Photograph: Paul-Antoine Libourel/ScienceSleep seems to be ubiquitous among animals, but it makes them vulnerable to predation because they lose the ability to respond quickly to the outside environment. Libourel said: “Sleep is at the core of animal behaviour, and is also under selective pressure. Most sleep research is conducted in rats, mice and humans, but working on other species shows us at what point sleep is affected by environmental change.”The researchers studied chinstrap penguins in the wild using electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and continuous video footage. Microsleeps were shown by sleep-related brain activity and eye-closure. They noted a slight increase in the depth of sleep at around noon, when risk of predation could be at its lowest.",

        "text": "The International Energy Agency in 2021 had an unambiguous message: developing new fossil fuel resources is incompatible with restricting global heating to below 1.5C, a threshold beyond which the most disastrous climate impacts lie. Yet the oil and gas industry isn’t listening. Last year it committed half a trillion dollars for new capital expenditure on future drilling and extraction, while making outrageous profits of $4tn. Business as usual will destroy life as we know it.Energy is fundamental for development and meeting basic needs. But producing it from coal, oil and gas is simultaneously the cause of the climate emergency. Clearly the issues of climate, energy and development must be addressed in an interconnected way. This is very difficult against a post-Covid backdrop when poor nations have record levels of debt. In the wake of the Ukraine invasion, rising interest rates have caused the dollar to surge – raising the cost of meeting loan repayments which are often denominated in the US currency. African nations spend up to five times their health budgets on debt obligations.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, should be congratulated for hosting a summit to reimagine financial solutions to the interlinked global goals of tackling poverty, curbing planet-destroying emissions and protecting nature. But there is still a long way to go. The announcement by the International Monetary Fund that rich countries had met a target, set in 2019, of a $100bn climate fund for poor countries is probably less than meets the eye. The contrast with the trillions of dollars mobilised in an instant, to bail out finance houses in 2008, is stark. It is inexcusable that funds to address global heating cannot be found.“For us it is about saving lives, for others, it is about saving profits,” said Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, chiding the rich world for inaction during a “polycrisis moment”. Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, called for a global financial transaction tax. Kenya’s president, William Ruto, came to Paris after endorsing a report, “Just Transition”, which pointed to Africa’s potential for harnessing renewable energy far outstripping any projected needs. Yet the continent has been barely able to industralise at all, let alone tap its vast green power potential.",

So when a female was seen apparently caring for the offspring of another species, it came as a bit of a surprise. “I saw straight away there was something weird about it,” says Marie-Thérèse Mrusczok, who was working as a spotter on the Láki Tours whale-watching boat that witnessed the encounter.The ship’s crew initially thought it was a very small killer whale calf swimming alongside the orca, but photos later confirmed what Mrusczok suspected – that the female, called Sædís, appeared to be looking after a newborn long-finned pilot whale.The unique sighting happened near Snæfellsnes, west Iceland, in August 2021, and is now the subject of a research paper published in the Canadian Journal of Zoology. “It’s another level of empathy we see in these animals if they are capable of caring for another species,” says Mrusczok, who is president of conservation nonprofit Orca Guardians Iceland and a researcher at the West Iceland Nature Research Centre.View image in fullscreenBig fin, little fin: a close-up shot of the adult orca and pilot whale calf together.

It is not known if the attraction from the calf was mutual, or how long their association went on for.The pair were seen swimming together for 21 minutes, and were accompanied by two other adults – a female named Dragonfly and a male called Zale who are often together as a group. Dragonfly and Zale tolerated the calf, but it is not known if, or how, they interacted with it directly.",

Native to China, they were first detected in Pennsylvania in 2014 and have since spread to at least 14 states.An adult is approximately an inch long, with black spots on its wings. Its hind legs have patches of red and black with a white band and its abdomen is yellow with black bands.Spotted lanternflies do not fly long distances. Instead, they lay mud-like egg masses on tree bark, decks, play equipment, lawnmowers, grills, and bikes and other modes of transportation, the US Department of Agriculture said.Lanternflies can lay egg masses with 30 to 50 eggs each and can severely affect the grape, orchard and logging industries, according to wildlife authorities.Without any indigenous predators, the species is so invasive authorities have long urged Americans to “kill it, squash it, smash it, just get rid of it”.The USDA now cautions travelers to frequently check vehicles, trailers and even clothes to avoid moving the insects from one area to another.In New York, experts are warning that residents may expect to see spotted lanternflies earlier as a result of an unusually warm spring.“With the warmer weather New York state is facing, we expect that [spotted lanternflies] may hatch earlier this year, within the next month or even sooner, in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley,” Chris Logue, director of plant industry at the New York state department of agriculture and markets, told NBC New York.One way experts advise residents to eliminate egg masses is by scraping them off hard surfaces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It found that the government’s net zero strategy was unlawful due to a breach of the 2008 Climate Change Act, given the document did not outline how climate policies would meet legally binding carbon budgets.Campaigners have called for regulation to be cut for new clean energy projects in order to speed up Britain’s energy independence and for potential savings to be passed on to consumers.Sunak told reporters on his way to a trilateral meeting with the Australian and US leaders: “Shortly we will be outlining, in the energy security strategy, an approach forward.”He said it would focus on “carbon capture and storage, small modular reactors and the like”, and talked up the success of investment in research and development of energy sources such as offshore wind.“I am very confident that we will continue to have a very vibrant set of companies and jobs created in the UK as we transition to net zero, and our track record should give everyone confidence we know how to do this and get it right,” Sunak said.Sam Richards, the founder and campaign director of the “pro-growth” campaign group Britain Remade, blamed Britain’s energy insecurity for “surging energy bills and unsustainable levels of borrowing”.He promoted the benefits of small modular reactors, which the World Economic Forum has identified as a new breed of power source that does not emit greenhouse gases and is less exposed to traditional dangers such as earthquakes and meltdowns.The technology is sparking a renaissance for nuclear energy, with a range of next-generation small modular reactors being developed in the US.",

Fir trees can be used in ice-cream, to pickle vegetables and even to flavour gin.Food experts say the needles can be used like rosemary or bay leaves in cooking to create a flavour of citrus and pine, and are also a good source of vitamin C.

For an even more chef-like option, she suggested making pine ash by putting sections of tree in a hot oven until charred before whizzing in a blender to create a black powder to use as flavouring.Needles can also be used to pickle eggs or vegetables and in drinks and infusions. For those who replant their trees, she recommends eating the new buds in spring.The London-based baker and food writer has been working with Christmas trees for years.

And the UN secretary general, António Guterres, added his voice calling on governments to halt new licences for oil and gas exploration and development.On the ground, climate scientists and academics have joined MPs and religious leaders as well as 200 charities and civil society groups to raise their opposition.But the UK government seems intent on pushing ahead, with ministers repeatedly saying the new oilfield is needed for energy security adding that it will help people struggling with the cost of living crisis.However, experts point out that last year 75% of the UK’s oil production was exported. They say the same is likely to happen with fossil fuels from any new development.No oil is expected to be produced from Rosebank until 2027 and, wherever the oil ends up, experts say it will be sold on the international market at the going rate, meaning it will have no little or no impact on the cost of living crisis or energy security.Tessa Khan, executive director of campaign group Uplift and a climate lawyer, said: “Rosebank is a rip-off.

Under government plans, homes with “off-grid” gas connections will be banned from buying replacement boilers from 2026 and instead expected to install air source or ground source heat pump systems.But Eustice, the Conservative MP for Camborne and Redruth, will on Wednesday argue in parliament that the costs involved in installing heat pumps in older rural properties present a “huge barrier”. Instead, Eustice said, kerosene oil boilers can run on “hydro-treated vegetable oil” (HVO) with a “minor adaptation” and reduce related greenhouse gas emissions by 88%.Eustice told the Guardian: “The government has pursued a heat-pump-first strategy but the cost to some households is prohibitively expensive, and will create a whole new industry of patching up old boilers. A good option is being overlooked here in favour of the best option, but if emissions can be reduced significantly and quickly it makes sense.”Eustice has called for an extension of the Renewable Transport FuelObligation that requires major fuel manufacturers or importers to purchase a proportion of their fuel from renewable sources. Eustice wants to see the system, which in effect subsidises renewable fuel, extended to suppliers of fuel for homes.He hopes there will be an amendment to the energy bill, which sets out large-scale changes for the industry and is being scrutinised by the House of Lords.Eustice said: “This system means less waste of resources because the fuel can run on existing boilers and central heating infrastructure with a simple, low-cost adaptation to the boiler.”Consumers with off-grid heating voiced concerns over the sharp rise in energy bills last year.",

Since 1700, according to research published this year, the UK has lost more than 75% of its wetlands as land has been drained for development and farming. The Industrial Revolution inevitably accelerated the destruction of terrain that was viewed simply as wasteland. But the tide may finally be turning for habitats that should be valued as 21st century environmental assets, crucial both to preserving biodiversity and protecting Britain’s coastline.The welcome nomination of England’s east wetlands as a possible Unesco world heritage site, announced by the government this month, potentially places them in the exalted company of the Galápagos Islands. For the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, the National Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which jointly put forward the application, the move is a vindication of their efforts to put marshland and mudflats stretching from the Humber to the Thames on the political map.A greater profile will rightly focus attention on ongoing conservation efforts, helping to safeguard the interests of the 155 bird species that rely on the wetlands and their intricate ecosystem. Among other things, these boggy expanses function as a kind of avian pit stop, serving migratory birds travelling the East Atlantic Flyway from the Arctic Circle to southern Africa. This spring, 200,000 birds will feast on their fish and insects, find rich pickings in the mud and use marsh and wet meadow to breed and roost.The bid is therefore good news for guests such as curlews, oystercatchers, knots and pink-footed geese. But the Unesco publicity should also be used kickstart a wider discussion on climate adaptation along Britain’s most vulnerable coastline.

The Victorian myth has been used for years by water companies as an excuse not to act because the task was just too great.In fact pipes, sewage and treatment plants mostly date back to the 1970s and 80s. In the more than three decades since water was privatised, there have been many opportunities to invest the necessary money to keep modernising, but as some water bosses now admit, they have instead overseen decades of underinvestment, while taking huge salaries – in one case £3.9m – and paying dividends to shareholders which last year reached £1.4bn.Within the puff of the announcement carefully placed in friendly media on Thursday by an industry forced into a change of tack, the crux is stark. It is the customer who will be paying for this trebled investment, which water companies should have been carrying out for years to fulfil their legal duties. And it has always been the customer who pays, as the once publicly owned utility has morphed over the decades into a highly complex, opaque financial instrument set up to maximise returns for investors.Now the customer will be asked to pay even more if the companies are true to their word and triple their investment.",

Almost two-thirds of people live with pollution that is twice the WHO standard.Neira said politicians must act swiftly to reduce the scale and severity of pollution.“As a medical doctor, I cannot resist the temptation to remind people that this is about strokes, this is about heart disease, this is about asthma, this is about lung cancer, diabetes, low birth weight, preterm births, cognitive decline,” she said. “We need to remind people that any time you breathe, you are breathing something toxic into your body which is having a devastating impact.”She said it would not be acceptable for 98% of Europeans to be supplied with dangerously polluted water, and the same should be true for the air they breathe.“People say our guidelines are very strict and very ambitious. But I don’t see ambition in proposing something that will make so many people less sick … Having the knowledge we have [on the health impacts of air pollution] I think there is a clear and absolute moral responsibility.”Last week the European parliament voted to adopt the WHO guidelines on PM2.5, but not until 2035.Neira welcomed the vote, but added: “We strongly urge countries to act swiftly, recognising that any shift in air quality levels will have a direct impact on public health, climate and the environment. Delaying these crucial measures will have severe and immediate consequences for people’s wellbeing and the planet.”The Guardian investigation found that the worst-hit country in Europe is North Macedonia, where almost two-thirds of people live in areas with more than four times the WHO guideline levels of PM2.5.",

She said: “Such a long journey is just an incredible feat because they have come miles and miles. To have multiple birds come over, and survive in this way, has just never happened before in my lifetime.”Birdwatchers gather at Ramsey Island nature reserve, in Pembrokeshire, to see the rare birds. Photograph: Courtesy of RSPB Ramsey IslandThe British birding website Rare Bird Alert described the “spew of uber-rare land birds” as “one of the most memorable couple of days in British and Irish birding history”.So far, 15 species have been spotted, with 49 individual birds. Included is the Canada warbler, which has never been seen before in the UK. Meanwhile, the bay-breasted warbler had only its second-ever UK sighting, and the magnolia warbler its third. All were spotted in Pembrokeshire, which got the lion’s share of activity.The Chester-based birder Toby Phelps, who was the first to spot the Canada warbler and magnolia warber, posted on X: “I am still in total shock from last week, these are by far the most incredible experiences I have ever had birding.”The birds’ arrival was “a bittersweet phenomenon”, Lees said.",

PFOA and another member of the family, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), have largely been banned, but remain in the environment because of their persistence. Studies have linked the PFAS family of chemicals to cancers, immunodeficiencies, reproductive harms and developmental effects in children. They are not easily metabolised by the body so build up in humans and animals over time.PFOA has been linked to cancer for some time but a growing body of evidence means it has now been upgraded to “category one”, which means it is “carcinogenic to humans”, according to the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).A recent report from the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) shows that approximately 12,000 samples taken from drinking water sources contain at least one PFAS of some kind.The highest concentration of PFOA detected in a drinking water source was 149 nanograms a litre (ng/l), 1.5 times the DWI’s maximum limit for tap water. PFOS, categorised by the IARC as a “possible carcinogen”, was found at levels as high as 1,869ng/l, although these levels will have been diluted before reaching a tap.Analysis of Environment Agency and water company data by Watershed Investigations showed that PFOA was detected in almost 1,000 drinking water sources sampled between 2006 and 2022. And tap water sampling around England found PFOA in more than half of the 45 samples taken, albeit below 10ng/l, deemed “low risk” by the DWI.Earlier this year, the Guardian and Watershed Investigations found that effluent from the site of a chemicals company flowing into a protected river in Lancashire contained “extremely high levels” of PFOA.",

However, Otis rapidly intensified en route to making landfall in Mexico, with winds increasing by about 70mph in just 12 hours, leaving little time for preparations to be made.This rapid intensification was one of the largest on record in the eastern Pacific and was fuelled by high ocean temperatures and reduced wind shear, which refers to a change in wind speed or direction with a change in height. The rapid and unexpected intensification of Otis was not accurately captured by weather models, in part because of limited data availability, with no radar available in the area it made landfall and only one flight taking place to make observations.00:00:59Hurricane Otis: before and after footage shows scale of destruction in Mexico's Acapulco – videoAcapulco is home to more than 1 million people.

Campaigners raised concerns at the time that it might not have the same teeth as the EU and that it would not be able to stop the government riding roughshod over environment protections.Last week the OEP wrote to the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, arguing that core parts of the national emissions ceiling regulations (NECR) should not be deleted under the Retained EU Law Act (REUL). However, Coffey has made it clear that the department will ignore the advice of the OEP.The act, which became law in June, will scrap hundreds of EU laws by the end of this year, including environmental protections, and the government voted down an amendment in the Lords that would have prioritised the environment.Dame Glenys Stacey, the chair of the watchdog, wrote: “In our view, the revocation of these regulations weakens accountability and transparency and in the absence of an alternative, comprehensive plan it has the potential to weaken environmental protection.”The parts of the regulations to be deleted require the government to prepare and implement its plan to reduce pollutants like nitrogen oxides and ammonia, and to review it if emissions are projected to exceed targets. The regulations also demand public consultation before revising the programme.She added these duties appeared even more important considering that the government “did not meet the emission reductions required for PM2.5 in 2021 [fine particulate matter]” – indicating insufficient progress is being made towards the UK’s legally binding emission reduction commitments.In her response Coffey indicated that the plans would proceed, and disagreed that there would be a “reduction in the level of environmental protection”. She claimed the “intent in removing regulations 9 and 10 of the NECR is to reduce administrative burdens and aid transparency regarding air quality emissions policy”.Lawyers and environment experts have criticised her response, saying it amounts to weakening existing legal air pollution protections.",

On the other, it has generally failed to enact the kind of legislation that would allow the UK to take a global lead in the battle against global heating, as can be seen from the records of three recent Tory prime ministers.Margaret ThatcherRemembered for her shortlived “green period” in the late 1980s when she helped put the climate crisis, acid rain and pollution on the political map. “Mankind and his activities are changing the environment of our planet in damaging and dangerous ways,” she told the UN general assembly in 1989. Her green enthusiasm did not last long, however, and by 1992 it had all but evaporated. She did not attend that year’s Rio Earth summit, leaving her successor, John Major, to sign up Britain to forest, climate and other agreements.

Because there are so many insect species, this doubles the global number of species at risk, according to the paper, published in Plos One on Wednesday.Lead researcher, Axel Hochkirch, from the Musée National d’Histoire Naturelle in Luxembourg, said: “What our study does is really highlight that insects are as threatened as other taxa. And because they are the most species-rich group of animals on our planet, this is really something which should be addressed.”Understanding what is happening to global insect populations has been challenging because of the lack of data – but 97% of all animals are invertebrates. Of that group, about 90% are classified as insects. They provide vital ecosystem services: pollinating crops, recycling nutrients into soils, and decomposing waste. “Without insects, our planet will not be able to survive,” Hochkirch said.The team looked at all European species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list of threatened species. This is considered the most comprehensive source of information on species at risk. They found a fifth of European species were at risk of extinction, with 24% of invertebrates at risk, as well as 27% of all plants and 18% of vertebrates.The garden tiger moth, once-common in Britain, whose numbers fell by 89% between 1968 and 2002.

Glyphosate separately has been linked to cancer and other health problems.‘Disturbing’: weedkiller ingredient tied to cancer found in 80% of US urine samplesRead more“If the developing fetus is especially vulnerable to glyphosate, it is critical to understand the magnitude and sources of exposure during this critical developmental period,” the new paper states.The authors include researchers from the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Washington; Boise State University; and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Glyphosate is the world’s most widely used herbicide and is the active ingredient in products sold around the world, including the widely used Roundup brand developed by Monsanto and now owned by Bayer after Bayer’s 2018 acquisition of Monsanto.The results of the study were considered somewhat surprising because none of the women studied worked with glyphosate or other herbicides or had a household member who worked with weedkillers, said Cynthia Curl, associate professor at Boise State and lead author on the paper.“What is going on? Is it drifting more than we think? Is it adhering to soil particles which then blow around and end up in people’s house dust? Is it drinking water? Until we figure that out we can’t suggest the right interventions,” Curl said.Curl said follow-up research will collect household dust and water samples to try to determine routes of exposure.To evaluate the exposure, the research team collected 453 urine samples biweekly from 40 pregnant women in southern Idaho from February through December 2021.

However, Stuart said the CCC had found aspects of climate policy that were improving.A group of more than 80 countries, including the UK, called for the phaseout of fossil fuels at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt last year, and are expected to make the same demand at Cop28 in Dubai.However, Stuart’s comments to the committee raised questions over whether the UK would take such a strong position this year.He told MPs: “There is nothing fundamentally wrong with oil and gas, it’s emissions from oil and gas that are the problem and that we must focus on.",

His mate is expected to arrive in April; they bred for the first time in 2022, becoming the first pair to do so after an absence of nearly 200 years.An adult osprey. Photograph: Mike Thornley/PAThe moment of celebration soon turned bittersweet as sinister, filmy slicks were blighting the surface of the natural harbour on Monday, with a major incident declared and a clean-up operation launched.The RSPB – which protects 250 hectares (630 acres) and six miles of coastline on Arne – has already identified birds covered in oil, including shelducks, Mediterranean gulls and black-headed gulls.On Shipstall Hill above the shoreline, Peter Robertson, senior sites manager at RSPB Arne, points to a passage of water between the privately owned Round Island and the peninsula where a slick was spotted earlier in the day, perilously close to the salt marshes that provides a habitat for thousands of wetland birds.“We have black-tailed godwits, avocets, curlews, spoonbills, they all occur in nationally important numbers,” Robertson says just before a large flock of brant geese noisily glide past, landing on the tip of nearby Long Island.That an oil leak can occur near Arne confounds Robertson. Poole harbour, he explains, is one of the most heavily protected natural areas in the UK, with protections at UK, European and global level.",

        "text": "About 30 years too late, many might say, here comes Ofwat with details on how it will “crack down”, as it puts it, on executive pay in the English water sector. Since the regulator’s new powers to interfere on boardroom pay don’t kick in until next year, this year’s assessment can be considered an explainer on how a new offside rule will work.And the news from the video assistant referee is that Severn Trent, South West Water and Portsmouth Water committed offences that “did not meet our expectations”, says Ofwat, because either short- or long-term incentives were insufficiently aligned to good outcomes for customers or the environment. Does that mean the executives would have faced the humiliation of returning their dodgy rewards?Well, no, Ofwat isn’t quite saying that. The regulator’s powers of intervention are limited to ensuring customers do not pay for misaligned bonuses, but it seems there’s nothing to stop shareholders from picking up the tab. How the distinction would be made is unclear. But, in principle at least, it appears Ofwat could intervene to “ban” a bonus only for the owners to say they’ll pay it anyway out of their pocket by taking, say, less in dividends than they would otherwise have done.For example, Severn Trent paid £261.3m in dividends last year. Would its shareholders have been happy with £259m if the remuneration committee said it was essential that chief executive Liv Garfield got her £2.3m variable pay in full? The answer, whether you like it or not, is probably “yes” since Severn Trent in recent years has been at, or near, the top of comparative (a crucial word in this context) tables for financial and environmental performance.The other big obstacle to serious reform can be called the bankers’ bonus cap problem: Ofwat’s powers cover only the variable performance-related element in pay packets, not fixed salaries. In the case of the bankers, salaries were brazenly hiked in about 2013, as everybody apart from naive EU officials predicted at the time.It would be harder for water companies to pull the same trick, but only because the outrage would be deafening.",

Shelves lined the walls from floor to ceiling, all full of ingredients from the mainstream to the obscure. One product I came across back then was apple butter, a creamy, apple jam with a wonderful texture that I presume was the result of the natural pectin in the apples. It is a rare find these days, but fortunately it’s very easy to make, and stores well, too, preserving floury, past-their-best apples for a rainy day.Maple apple butterAccording to the government waste scheme Wrap, we throw away around 800,000 apples in the UK every day. By this time of year, home-grown apples can often be a bit iffy, because they’ve been in storage since late autumn and can therefore have turned floury and have a short shelf life. Apple butter is a great way to transform a bad batch or glut of reduced-price apples into something truly delicious. This thick puree stores well and is impressively versatile. Simply spread on toast, serve as a condiment alongside roast chicken, pork or potatoes, use it to flavour cocktails or even to fill homemade pastries or doughnuts.In the US, people often flavour apple recipes with a pre-made apple pie spice mix, and here’s a rough guide to making your own. Mix a teaspoon of ground cinnamon, a quarter-teaspoon of ground nutmeg, an eighth of a teaspoon each of ground allspice and ginger, and a pinch of ground cloves; other spices you could add are ground turmeric, star anise, cardamom, mace and even a careful pinch of black pepper if you want some heat.",

Two-thirds of these complaints were not followed up, and only a handful led to any action.Urban areas with high particulate pollution face restrictions on burning wood, to avoid more particulates spewing into the air. Particle pollution is associated with increased mortality from causes including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer.Dirty air causes 26,000 to 38,000 early deaths a year in England, and the particles are linked to many other health problems including dementia and depression. Wood burning has overtaken traffic in the UK as one of the most harmful sources of the smallest particles, known as PM2.5. Emissions of PM2.5 from wood burning increased by 35% between 2010 and 2020, the Times reported.In smoke-control areas, households can only burn unauthorised fuels, such as wood, on appliances that are rigorously tested to demonstrate low-smoke emissions. Fines of up to £300 and criminal prosecutions, which could result in fines of up to £5,000, can be brought under the Environment Act 2021.Only about 8% of people in the UK burn solid-fuels indoors, meaning a small minority are responsible for significant amounts of pollution. Two-thirds of these people live in urban areas, where the impact of air pollution is worst, and virtually all of them have other sources of heating.Research by the campaign group Mums for Lungs found 80 local authorities said they were not using the new powers, while 47 councils said the measures did not apply to them.In January, the government promised to introduce legislation after the publication of the environmental improvement plan (EIP) 2023 that would cut the emissions limit of wood burning stoves from 5g smoke an hour to 3g.",

This requires them to submit their plans for validation within 24 months.But only one corporation, the renewable energy company Iberdrola, is a validated member of the SBTi scheme, with a fully committed target date for cutting its emissions.The sponsorship committee in the United Arab Emitrates, which holds the Cop presidency this year, said organisations seeking to sponsor the event were required to submit their commitments to net zero and climate action as part of their sponsorship applications.But its wording leaves wriggle room for sponsors, saying they need to be signed up to “credible net zero transition plans by 2030 and 2050 based on SBTi”, rather than the globally recognised scheme itself.Lincoln Bauer of Spendwell, which carried out the analysis, said: “Science-based targets are the gold standard validation system for companies.",

        "text": "There has been keen interest over recent weeks in the much-anticipated sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event, which only began this week but is now well under way. The SSW phenomenon is linked to the polar vortex, an area of low pressure across the North Pole that forms within the stratosphere during autumn, as temperatures plummet in the absence of solar radiation.SSW events are very common and occur two in every three winters. It remains unclear how climate change will affect these events in the future. As the vortex develops during autumn and into winter, westerly stratospheric winds increase in strength. But in the event of a SSW episode, stratospheric temperatures rise rapidly in the space of only a few days, leading to the weakening or even reversal of these winds. The zonal mean winds at 10hPa pressure – about 30km high – turned to an easterly direction on 15 Wednesday February, significantly displacing the polar vortex away from the North Pole. The vortex and zonal winds are forecast to stay much weaker than normal for the remainder of February and into the first half of March.The consequences of this warming will spread slowly into the troposphere and can, over time, disrupt the jet stream that influences our weather on the surface. A weakened jet stream can help in the development of large “blocking” areas of high pressure. Should high pressure build across Scandinavia, it can feed very cold polar air from the east into western Europe and towards the UK. However, it is important to note that not all SSW events are the same, and not all will lead to cold conditions in Europe. The eventual effects of such SSW events are not usually experienced until two to three weeks after they begin.Meanwhile, intense heat affected large parts of Argentina during the first half of February, in what was the country’s eighth heatwave this summer. This followed the warmest November to January period since 1961, with the National Meteorological Service of Argentina reporting that average temperatures were 1.7C higher than normal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

During his campaign Lula vowed to stamp out environmental crime and champion Indigenous people, and after taking power in January put the veteran environmentalist Marina Silva in charge of environmental affairs and made the Indigenous activist Sônia Guajajara head of a new ministry for Indigenous peoples.But that optimism received a dramatic reality check on Wednesday as members of the conservative-dominated congress – where the ruralista caucus representing agribusiness interests remains a powerful force – moved to severely weaken both ministries.By 15 votes to 3, a congressional committee approved draft legislation that would strip the environment ministry of control of the rural environmental registry, a key tool in the fight against illegal deforestation and land-grabbing, and water resources. The rule change would also strip the ministry for Indigenous peoples of responsibility for delimiting Indigenous territories, handing those powers to the justice ministry.Silva and Guajajara both denounced the moves, amid anger and alarm that members of Lula’s administration had not done more to oppose the changes, which are likely to be voted on by the lower house and senate in the coming days.“They are fleecing the environment ministry,” Marina Silva told the newspaper O Globo.“The Brazilian people elected President Lula but it seems congress wants a repeat of the Bolsonaro government,” Silva added, warning the moves would undermine Brazil’s international claims to be committed to fighting deforestation and climate change.Guajajara told AFP that attempts to erode her ministry’s powers went “totally against what president Lula is defending” and represented a “step backwards” for Indigenous rights.A prominent political columnist, Miriam Leitão, claimed the changes were tantamount to “the demolition of the [two] ministries”.",

The flight, partly funded by the UK government, flew to great fanfare from airlines and ministers as a potentially guilt-free way to fly. However, scientists and environmental groups are more sceptical.The climate charity Possible and the law firm Leigh Day have filed formal complaints against the two major airlines over their claims about reducing emissions from flights.The senior campaigner at Possible, Alethea Warrington, said: “The reality is that technologies for cleaner flight either don’t work, or don’t even exist yet. We think that airlines’ misleading claims about their emissions are unfair on people who want to do the right thing when they travel. It’s time for airlines to start being honest about their sky-high emissions.”Can UK’s ‘jet zero’ hopes take off with a plane fuelled by used cooking oil?Read moreThe complaints, filed under the National Contact point mechanism run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), set out that both airlines are misleading consumers over their claims on reducing carbon emissions from flights as the layperson does not have the expertise to discern the limits of decarbonisation technology.Airlines claim they can use biofuels made from crops or green hydrogen made from renewable energy, but recent research from the Royal Society has found the UK would have to devote half its farmland or more than double its total renewable electricity supply to make enough aviation fuel to meet its ambitions for net zero flying.The filing highlights that BA claims to be “driving urgent action towards net-zero emissions” and that it says it has a “clear roadmap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050”.

        "text": "When the government controversially scrapped its discount on the purchase of electric cars last summer, the move was justified on the grounds that its work was done. After 11 years of subsidies, said ministers, the electric vehicle revolution had been “kickstarted”. As Britain strives to meet a 2030 target to end the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, that judgment is beginning to look a little complacent.Amid ongoing economic headwinds, data has emerged that suggests a drop-off in current demand for electric cars, despite notable public enthusiasm for their adoption in principle. Auto Trader, which hosts the country’s largest car sales website, reported this month that inquiries in relation to new electric vehicles had fallen significantly compared with last year.A number of factors are likely to be involved. As interest rates and inflation remain high, the upfront cost of a new electric car makes it more expensive in the short term than a petrol or diesel one. Falling oil prices may have diminished the immediate incentive to switch. At the same time, despite repeated pledges by Whitehall, the rollout of charging infrastructure continues to be too slow and is not keeping pace with sales.Under Boris Johnson, the government forecast that 300,000 publicly available chargers would be needed by 2030. Reaching that number would require the installation of 100 chargers a day, but the current rate is estimated to be around a fifth of that. For lower-income families without the option of charging their cars in garages or driveways, the problem is compounded by current electricity prices and the substantially higher VAT rate paid at public charging points.The net result is that while sales of electric vehicles are growing in absolute terms and company fleet sales are strong – partly as a result of specific incentives to employers – the electric share of the new vehicle market is not accelerating as it needs to. For mass adoption to take place in tough economic times, the government needs to do much more to make electric cars affordable through creative grants and subsidies. Loans should be cheaper and easier to access, offsetting upfront costs.",

        "text": "Cuts to post-Brexit farming payments mean farms risk “going out of business” as new figures reveal only a tiny fraction of a new scheme designed to replace lost subsidies went to agriculture businesses last year.The government is replacing the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which paid subsidies to farmers to keep them in business, with “payments for public goods”, meaning land managers get paid for improving nature.Each year, ministers are cutting how much farmers get paid under the old scheme while they introduce new ones, which last year commenced with the launch of the sustainable farming incentive (SFI). This paid farmers for looking after their soil.While subsidies were cut by an average of 22% for farmers last year, the money paid out through the SFI equated to only 0.44% of the total funding plan for farmers, leaving farmers asking where the money is going. This year, the cuts are set to be even more stark, with the government planning to slash payments by 36%.Data revealed to the Observer under the Freedom of Information Act from the Rural Payments Agency shows that a total of £10,692,415 was paid out under the sustainable farming incentive scheme in the 2022 calendar year. This is out of a budget of £2.4bn, meaning only 0.44% was spent on the new schemes.Farmers have said they are noticing an underspend, with money missing from the rural community. Jake Fiennes, a conservationist who manages a large farm on the Holkham Estate, Norfolk, saw the farm’s subsidies cut by about 45% last year.“In the last financial year, there was an underspend of about £100m. It looks like this is to be the case again. Our direct support has been reduced and we want to know where that money is going,” he said.Dither and delay over introducing the new payment programme, including threats from the Liz Truss government that they would scrap it altogether, meant that many farmers have not signed up.“These figures show that the Conservatives have broken their promise to farmers to keep farm funding at CAP levels,” said Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson. “They have rushed to cut basic payments and failed to deliver the new schemes on time.",

Russia produced 150m tonnes in 2022 and expects to produce 120m tonnes this year.The soil-dwelling invertebrates contribute to 6.5% of grain harvests, according to the study, published in Nature Communications this week. Crops include rice, maize, wheat and barley. If an average loaf of bread is made up of 15 slices, this means one per loaf depends on worms’ activity to be produced.Earthworms contribute to the growing of 2.3% of legumes, which includes soya beans, peas, chickpeas and lentils. This is probably smaller because legumes can fix their own nitrogen, which makes them less dependent on worms, researchers said.As worms burrow and feed underground, they break down organic matter and aerate soils, increasing fertility and making nutrients available for smaller organisms. They also help soils capture and retain water.Scientists have long been aware that the presence of earthworms makes crops grow better – naturalist Charles Darwin was writing about it in 1881 – but before this research, it wasn’t known by how much.“This is the first effort that I’m aware of that’s trying to take one piece of soil biodiversity and say: ‘OK, this is the value of it; this is what it’s giving us on a global scale,’” said lead researcher Steven Fonte from Colorado State University. “Soils are just such an intricate habitat but there has really been very few efforts to understand what that biodiversity means to our global crop yields.”Indian mystic Sadhguru on 100-day motorbike mission to save soilRead moreResearchers looked at the impact of worms on grains and legumes by analysing and overlaying maps of soil properties and crop yields with a global atlas of earthworm abundance.Earthworms contributed proportionally more in areas of the global south: 10% of grain yield in sub-Saharan Africa, and 8% in Latin America and the Caribbean, is down to worms, researchers said.",

In the Tigris-Euphrates basin, which covers large parts of Syria and Iraq, droughts of this severity happened about once every 250 years before global heating – now they are expected once a decade.In Iran, extreme drought occurred once every 80 years in the past but now strikes every five years on average in today’s hotter world. Further global heating, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, will make these droughts even more common.The study also found that existing vulnerability from years of war and political instability had reduced people’s ability to cope with the drought, turning it into a humanitarian disaster.The researchers said it was vital to plan for more frequent droughts in the future.“Our study has shown that human-caused climate change is already making life considerably harder for tens of millions of people in west Asia,” said Prof Mohammad Rahimi, at Semnan University, Iran. “And with further warming, Syria, Iraq and Iran will become even harsher places to live.”A person walks amid drought and low water levels in the Euphrates River, in Tabqa, Syria.

Consequently, we have already signalled to Ofwat that we are behind on our 2022/23 leakage performance and our target this year will now be very challenging to achieve.“As annual leakage targets are based on a three-year rolling average, the impact of this year will be felt, not just this year but for the next two years’ performance.”Thames is proposing controversial measures to tackle drought in the future, including a “recycling” scheme in which up to 100m litres of treated sewage from the Mogden sewage works will be pumped into the River Thames at Teddington, south-west London, every day. This will replace 100m litres abstracted from the Thames to tackle water shortages.The project raises environmental concerns including increased water temperatures and a change in the salinity of the river, which will affect fish and biodiversity.It also involves digging three to four 10.5-metre shafts within a protected nature reserve, Ham Lands, a site of importance for nature conservation (SINC), according to Thames documents.The company is also proposing to transport 155m litres of water a day from Wales, in another sensitive policy to try to tackle water shortages in London and the south-east.But its failure to fix its own leaks – which are estimated to be 630m litres a day – is likely to make it more difficult for Thames to get approval for these proposals in its draft water resources management plan.Bentley blamed the hot, dry weather last summer, followed by a wet winter, for exacerbating leaks from the network and from customers’ homes.",

And the problem is likely to get worse unless new, humane measures to curtail animal numbers are developed in the near future, say scientists.It is a critical environmental issue that will be debated this week at a major conference in Italy where experts will discuss how best to limit numbers of grey squirrels, wild boar, deer, feral goats, pigeons, parakeets and other creatures that are causing widespread ecological damage in many countries.A key approach to be highlighted at the meeting will be the need to develop contraceptives for animals. These would provide conservationists and farmers with a means to curtail animal numbers in a humane way, say researchers.Wild boar provide an illustration of the issues involved. Their numbers are rising across Europe, and UK breeding populations have been established in areas such as the Forest of Dean. With their large snouts and muscular necks, boar are good at rooting up fungi and seeds and can destroy crops, vulnerable habitats, ground-nesting animals and fragile root systems. Wild boar have also been linked to the spread of African swine fever to domestic pigs.The 2.7 million population of grey squirrels in the UK are threatening the native red species. Photograph: Krzysztof W/Getty Images/500px“Controlling numbers of animals like wild boar used to be achieved by shooting them, but hunting is not as popular as it used to be and is also more expensive, requiring expensive licences,” said Dr Giovanna Massei, Europe director of the Botstiber Institute for Wildlife Fertility Control at York University.She added: “Numbers of individuals who hunt animals are declining in many parts of Europe. As a result, controls of boar populations have weakened.”One solution is to develop boar contraceptives. “Preventing these animals from breeding is a humane way to limit numbers,” added Massei, who will be speaking at the European vertebrate pest management conference in Florence.In the US and Europe, scientists have launched projects aimed at developing contraceptive chemicals that could be mixed with food and would drastically limit boar fertility.",

This means 136,000 more homes will be at risk of flooding since plans were drawn up in 2020, figures from an NAO report show.Despite the government doubling its capital funding in England to £5.2bn to combat the danger of flooding, a quarter of new flood defence projects will now not go ahead. The Environment Agency (EA) has blamed inflation for the cuts in protection.Thousands of homes have been flooded during storms this autumn. Storm Babet was confirmed to have caused more than 2,000 homes to flood, while Storm Ciarán flooded more than 1,000. Storm Debi, which is causing havoc in Ireland, is expected to hit the west of England this week.

It had a target of protecting 336,000 homes by 2027.A shortfall in the agency’s finances means it cannot keep enough flood protections in the required condition to prevent destruction to homes. Due to inflation, the EA is £34m short of its expected budget, which means it will be be able to maintain only 94% to 95% of its assets at the required condition, resulting in 203,000 properties at increased risk of flooding. It had aimed to maintain 98% of its high-consequence assets at their required condition.The flood protection programme got off to a slow start. There was an underspend of £310m in its first two years, which has been deferred by the Treasury to make sure the government meets its target of spending £5.2bn on flood defences by 2027. Because of this underspend the EA will have to spend an average of almost £1bn each year over the remaining four years of the programme.

With catastrophic rates of bird flu currently contributing to serious concerns about disease in wildlife, the new report may have important implications for the way such outbreaks are tracked.The area surveyed was a wild expanse on the coast of the Dutch Wadden Sea, where both species of seals “haul out” on the intertidal flats and beaches to rest, socialise, mate and give birth. They gather there in great numbers. Up to 6,500 grey seals choose the high sandbanks, while harbour seals – about 8,000 were observed – prefer sands revealed at low tide.Unfortunately, the large numbers of harbour seals have faced disastrous outbreaks of disease in the past. Phocine (seal) distemper virus ravaged the populations in 1988 and 2002, halving numbers. About 18,000 harbour seals died of distemper in the UK and Europe in the 1988 outbreak. Grey seals, however, remained relatively unharmed.A grey seal colony on the sand of the Wadden Sea on the north-western coast of the Netherlands. Photograph: Jeroen Hoekendijk/Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research/Wageningen Marine Research“Many grey seals were actually also infected, but just didn’t get as sick as harbour seals,” said Hoekendijk. “This may actually have contributed to the spread of the virus. They carry the virus, but can still move around freely.” He pointed to recent evidence that the grey’s reduced susceptibility had “genetic underpinnings”.Fascinatingly, it may be that the social distancing described in the new report represents a memory of those severe outbreaks.",

They told me they wanted to get on with a free trade agreement and I hope we can resume our talks soon.” She added that the other 49 states have “fantastic produce”.There have been fears that a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the US could cause the UK to lower its food import standards, for example by bringing in hormone-fed beef.The speech was the first time a non-US minister has addressed the conference, which officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said “demonstrates the strength of UK and US collaboration on sustainable agriculture, food security and improving nature and biodiversity”.Coffey also hinted that new legislation could be coming on food self-sufficiency after a year of turmoil in the agriculture industry. She said: “In the UK, we only have domestic self-sufficiency of about 60% and we want to maintain that at least, if not consider higher.” This year, the UK faced egg shortages due to bird flu, with farms going out of business, as well as glasshouse companies that grow fruit, vegetables and salad closing down due to energy prices.",

        "text": "The US chemical industry likely spent over $110m during the last two election cycles deploying lobbyists to kill dozens of pieces of PFAS legislation and slow administrative regulation around “forever chemicals”, a new analysis of federal lobbying documents has found.The industry’s onslaught was effective: only eight pieces of legislation that targeted PFAS made it through Congress, the paper prepared by the Food and Water Watch (FWW) nonprofit found.“There’s an extreme amount of money that’s going into fighting [PFAS legislation],” said Amanda Starbuck, FWW’s research director and the lead author on the report. “It’s hard to win these fights when there’s so much funding being put in from the opposing side.”PFAS are a class of about 14,000 compounds used to make products resist water, stains and heat. They are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and they have been linked to cancer, high cholesterol, liver disease, kidney disease, fetal complications and other serious health problems.As the dangers from PFAS have come into sharper focus over the last decade, lawmakers, the Environmental Protection Agency and other administrative agencies have come under an ever-increasing amount of pressure to rein in the chemicals use and clean up pollution. Chemical manufacturers’ spending has jumped in response, the report noted“The chemical and associated industries are powerful and have used their army of lobbyists and campaign finance war chests to thwart meaningful action,” the paper states.It looked at lobbying records for eight major producers, such as 3M, Chemours, and Honeywell. During the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 election cycles, over 130 PFAS bills were introduced in Congress, the report noted. Of the eight that passed, only two were stand alone bills, while PFAS provisions were included in several larger pieces of legislation, like the National Defense Authorization Act.Though the report identified over $110m in spending in lobbying records that mention PFAS legislation or rules, it is unclear what portion of that was spent solely on PFAS proposals because lobbying documents are not specific.",

That figure, experts said, was likely to be far below the true number, since many dead birds in the densely packed cliff colonies would have fallen into the sea.Thousands of seabirds are returning to the islands and the positive cases have left rangers braced for a repeat of last year.Harriet Reid, lead ranger for the islands, said: “Sadly, with confirmed cases there is a strong likelihood that we will see thousands of birds affected by the virus again this year.”Many of the bird species on the islands are rare or struggling because of the climate crisis.“By restricting access to the islands for visitors and limiting disturbance – which can cause distress to sick birds and potentially increase the transmission of bird flu – we hope to give the birds the best chance of survival,” said Reid.National Trust has been caring for the islands, home to about 200,000 seabirds annually, for nearly a century. There are no records, the trust said, of anything so potentially damaging to the already endangered colonies.",

At another station, Albert Park, there was 280mm in one day, with 211mm falling in less than six hours.These totals are more than 8.5 times higher than a typical January, and more than 2.5 times higher than an entire typical summer. Overall, Auckland has had the wettest January since records began, with more than half a metre of rain falling in places. The rainfall has caused numerous landslips, flooding and damage to roads and properties with four people killed and 350 in need of emergency accommodation. More than 9,000 people are still stranded as flights in and out of Auckland experiencing delays and cancellations.Last weekend in the US, a strong cold front progressed southward into Texas, with sites in Oklahoma recording a 10-20F drop in temperature within an hour. Cold air lingered at and near the surface in the Southern Plains into this week, but south-westerly flow at higher altitudes advected warmer air over the top of this shallow cold layer.This combination helped produce freezing rain, a phenomenon where rain becomes supercooled through the cold surface layer, landing and turning to ice as it hits any surfaces. The freezing rain coated roads and weighed down trees with a glazing of ice, causing many road accidents.

He could tell the snow was abundant last winter, and verified it up close when he floated through fresh powder alongside his wife and three sons at the popular Winter Park resort.But one season of above-average snowfall wasn’t enough to refill the dwindling reservoir he relies on to irrigate his pumpkins. He received news this spring that his water delivery would be about half of what it was from the previous season, so he planted just half of his typical pumpkin crop. Then heavy rains in May and June brought plenty of water and turned fields into a muddy mess, preventing any additional planting many farmers might have wanted to do.Sam Bankman-Fried testifies for third day at FTX fraud trial after admitting ‘large mistakes’Read more“By time it started raining and the rain started to affect our reservoir supplies and everything else, it was just too late for this year,” Mazzotti said.For some pumpkin growers in states such as Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, this year’s pumpkin crop was a reminder of the water challenges hitting agriculture across the south-west and west as human-caused climate change exacerbates drought and heat extremes. Some farmers lost 20% or more of their predicted yields; others, like Mazzotti, left some land bare. Labor costs and inflation are also narrowing margins, hitting farmers’ ability to profit off what they sell to garden centers and pumpkin patches.This year’s thirsty gourds are a symbol of the reality that farmers who rely on irrigation must continue to face season after season: they have to make choices, based on water allotments and the cost of electricity to pump it out of the ground, about which acres to plant and which crops they can gamble on to make it through hotter and drier summers.",

Funding for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), which investigates pollution and protects water quality, had fallen by 26%.The cuts raise profound questions for the Scottish government about its ability to meet increasingly urgent nature and climate targets, which are likely to cost billions of pounds to achieve, the charities say.The group, which includes the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the John Muir Trust, Trees for Life, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, Buglife and Plantlife, have urged the Scottish government to increase environment spending at its next budget, later in December.The programmes affected, they say, include a pledge made by Scottish ministers after an international biodiversity summit to protect 30% of nature by 2030, a target underpinned by the convention on biological diversity agreed in Montreal last December.In a joint letter coordinated by Scottish Environment Link, an umbrella group of nature and conservation groups, the signatories said: “The Scottish government is rightly committed to setting ambitious targets for environmental action.“But as the impacts of climate change and nature loss become more strongly felt, simply maintaining current environmental standards will become harder. The longer we do not act, the more expensive and less palatable it will become.”The signatories said the cuts have meant: Nearly 60% of Scotland’s legally protected sites of special scientific interest – the most precious in the country – have not been assessed in more than a decade, with only 65% in favourable condition. Only half of the sites which make up Scotland’s “Atlantic rainforest” are in favourable condition. Scottish government funding for nature fell from 0.55% of its total budget to 0.",

California’s Chevron had a record $36.5bn profit, while Shell announced the best results of its 115-year history, a $39.9bn surplus, and BP, another London-based firm, notched a $27.7bn profit. The French company TotalEnergies also had a record, at $36.2bn.When the 2022 results for all publicly traded oil and gas companies are tallied the total profits are expected to exceed $400bn, “a number we’ve never seen before, and one that was built off the backs of working families who were victimized by oil and gas executives’ greed”, according to Claire Moser, deputy executive director of the US activist group Climate Power.Bar chart comparing oil company profits to climate budgetsThe stratospheric profits were criticized as “outrageous” by Joe Biden during his State of the Union address on Tuesday. Biden said that “we’re still going to need oil and gas for a while” but the US president attacked companies for enriching shareholders through share buybacks rather than helping alleviate rising gasoline costs for drivers.The big five oil and gas companies have already confirmed that most of the bumper profits will be going to stock buybacks and dividends. The $200bn in combined profits equates to about five times the US’s annual foreign aid budget, or about double what the world gave to Ukraine last year in military and humanitarian assistance.",

The US Department of Agriculture uses these devices to kill predators and other wildlife.“This has been a long road,” said Brooks Fahy, the executive director of the conservation group Predator Defense, who has spent decades fighting the use of cyanide bombs in the US. “I consider this in the annals of conservation wildlife predator issues to be a historic event.”For decades, a little-known federal program called Wildlife Services has used cyanide bombs to kill wild animals like coyotes that can prey on livestock and cause other problems for agricultural interests. The small spring-loaded devices are primarily planted on private holdings with permission from landowners, but they are also sometimes deployed on public lands. When triggered by an unsuspecting animal, they release a cloud of sodium cyanide that can quickly kill.Wildlife Services, a program within the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, has used M-44s to kill tens of thousands of animals over the last decade. Non-target animals, including imperiled wildlife and family pets, have repeatedly died by these devices as well, and a concerted campaign to ban their use on public land has been gaining momentum in recent years.Canyon Mansfield holds the collar of his dog, Casey, who was killed by a cyanide-ejecting device placed on public land near his home in Pocatello, Idaho.

The study, from the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), based on extensive interviews with consumers, found widespread misunderstandings around common terms such as “biodegradable”, “compostable” and “recyclable”, leaving participants angry when they discovered what they meant.According to the ASA, households in the UK take pride in recycling and food-waste management, and hope to play their part in preventing the destruction of nature by putting rubbish into correct bins or buying products with green packaging.However, some participants in the new research believed the labelling meant that packaging would disappear entirely or decompose. Some of those surveyed were surprised to learn that “biodegradable” packaging has an unlimited timeframe to break down and could produce toxins.Many “compostable” products need to be taken to a specialist waste centre and would not break down in a household compost bin, although many of those surveyed believed the products could be composted at home.‘It’s greenwash’: most home compostable plastics don’t work, says studyRead moreMiles Lockwood, director of complaints and investigations at the ASA, said the regulator would be cracking down on the use of the terms in adverts as part of its action on greenwashing.“Consumers were telling us that they were proud of what they were doing on the environment.

Aquifers feed rivers to keep their flows at a healthy level, and are also important sources of water when reservoirs or other sources run low.There are strict limits on the amount of water that companies can take from aquifers, as rivers can be damaged and an important emergency water source for local people is lost if they are drained. Campaigners have previously said water companies should be fixing leaks in the system and building reservoirs rather than over-abstracting water from the environment.United Utilities was prosecuted at Warrington magistrates court and was given the fine on Tuesday after the Environment Agency found the company had taken more water than its abstraction licences allowed in the Franklaw and Broughton borehole complex.Carol Holt, the Environment Agency area director for Lancashire, said: “While water companies are allowed to abstract water from the environment, over-abstraction, especially during times of prolonged dry weather, has damaging impacts to our environment.“Our actions as regulator have led to today’s sentencing and we will continue to strive for a better water sector across the country to protect our precious water supplies now, and for the future. We are transforming our approach to regulation, holding the water industry to account and working with water companies such as United Utilities Water Ltd to help them improve.”The water company said during the hearing that it had made internal improvements so that over-abstraction would not happen again, and committed to supporting a number of local Rivers Trust schemes.

Compost? Dump? Solving the eco-conundrum of nappiesRead moreDisposable nappies are one of the biggest single contributors to plastic waste worldwide, but a 2005 life cycle analysis declared there was “little or no difference between the environmental impact of reusable and disposable nappies”.This resulted in a lack of action from policymakers, according to campaigners, who say the government has a responsibility to make it easier for parents to switch to reusables.“We’ve seen the British government be really bold on lots of stuff to do with single-use plastic,” said Elisabeth Whitebread of the Nappy Alliance campaign group. “We’ve had the first plastic packaging tax in the world, we’ve recently seen them banning single-use plastic cutlery and plates, but by the number of items, as well as the weight and volume, nappies represent a much greater contribution to single-use plastic waste.“This clearly needs policy initiative but also awareness raising – so many people don’t even think about nappies as a single-use plastic.”Hilary Vick, a founder of the washable nappy service Nappy Ever After, added: “The playing field is unequal because parents and carers have the task and the expense of washing nappies and the time it takes, and yet the disposal of nappies is free. They’re readily available in supermarkets, which makes it seem normal – governments and local authorities have a responsibility to go against those norms.",

According to Schladow, the zooplankton, especially the Daphnia and Bosmina species, “largely disappeared from the lake after they were grazed down following the introduction of the Mysis shrimp in the 1960s”.Other factors can affect changes in lake clarity including winter runoff, the warming of the lake’s surface and the concentration of particles such as silt, algae or clay. But TERC’s research says the primary factor in the lake’s recent clarity sits squarely with the Daphnia and Bosmina zooplankton.“These events support the hypothesis we put forward several years ago that the food web is a major factor in controlling lake clarity,” said Brant Allen, a TERC boat captain.However, the assistance provided by nature’s cleanup crew may be only short-term.",

On Friday, the Met Office put 12 areas of the UK, covering England, Wales and most of Scotland, on red alert for “very high” pollen levels.“We are seeing lots of high count days because the weather is very suitable for pollen emission from grasses,” said Dr Beverley Adams-Groom, a senior palynologist at the University of Worcester, who leads the UK’s pollen forecasting programme in association with the Met Office.Adams-Groom said pollen counts this year were roughly average, but added: “The problem for hay fever sufferers is not so much the size of the pollen count, since any amount over 50 pollen grains per cubic metre of air is problematic for the majority, it is more the perpetual onslaught of high days, due to the almost continuous good weather in many regions since the season began in late May/early June.”If the hot weather continues into next week, the grasses will become exhausted more quickly, offering some respite to those with hay fever, she said. “Already, I am seeing some evidence that this is happening, with grasses going over very quickly.”Typically, the season for grass pollen, which causes most allergies, lasts from mid-May until July, while the weed pollen season generally covers the end of June to September. The Met Office pollen forecast show that some areas are getting a double hit.Hay fever symptoms include sneezing, coughing, a runny or blocked nose, as well as red, itchy or watery eyes. Sufferers can also experience headaches, earache or lose their sense of smell.Scientists predict that as global heating causes a higher frequency of hotter, drier summers and warmer wetter winters in the UK, the seasonal pollen pattern could change. “There’s a growing scientific consensus that climate change will impact the pollen season in the UK.",

When I moved into my small cob-and-thatch cottage 10 years ago, there were storage heaters (which I removed) and an open fire that filled the place with smoke due to a jackdaw nest in the chimney. I installed an air-source heat pump, and a small wood-burning stove for extra warmth in winter.This is affordable, as the heat pump is cheap and efficient, and my supply of dry logs will last all winter for a few hundred pounds. Thick walls and low ceilings make it easy to heat the cottage. I find this solution economical and in keeping with my quaint dwelling and an old-fashioned lifestyle, which I had thought was ecological. I do have asthma, which is under control, but the stove may not help. Burning wood is not ideal. But I see no alternative here other than an electric stove, which would be much more expensive to run. My stove also gives a companionable glow on a winter night, which I would be sorry to lose.David CottamMorchard Bishop, Devon George Monbiot berates himself for installing wood-burning stoves, without allowing for the range of building types in the UK.

Plenty of the shops and pubs have hanging baskets, and they can continue to do that – nobody’s banning them,” she said. “What we’re doing is trialling a different form of environmentally friendly council planting. To be honest with you, this is a politically motivated row that has been manufactured.”Riddle said the council had already stated that if the new displays were hated, there was “nothing to stop” the council reinstating baskets next year.“Salisbury’s history is one of its principal glories, but it can’t live in the past,” she said. “There are other ways that things can look nice, be more friendly to wildlife and provide more shade. We hope that that style of planting will attract more wildlife and be more bee-friendly.”In a review in 2019, the council committed to making the city as carbon neutral as possible by 2030 to help tackle the climate change emergency.",

She and her team constructed a model that simulated follow-up of the entire Australian population yearly from 2021 to 2030, capturing bushfire deaths and years of life lived.

The model made conservative predictions, as it assumed no changes to GDP over the time period given uncertainty regarding inflation in the current economic climate.The model also did not estimate the health burden of bushfire smoke due to non-physical conditions, such as mental health, nor the burden borne by community-based healthcare services, and did not capture the impact on GP consultations nor the increased dispensation of medications for respiratory conditions. The costs of devoting healthcare resources away from other conditions was also not considered.“Even based on conservative assumptions, the health and economic burden of bushfires in Australia looms large,” the paper, published in the journal Current Problems in Cardiology, concluded.“Human-induced climate change is increasing the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires.

Under Bell’s leadership, Ealing trialled several so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), one of which has since been removed.The LTN scheme promotes walking and cycling by using planters or bollards to make some residential streets access-only for motor traffic, while allowing pedestrians and cyclists to use them as normal. While there is evidence the schemes can, over time, reduce the overall number of shorter car trips, some opponents claim they increase congestion by pushing through motor traffic on to a smaller number of streets.Bell’s analysis showed that in five Ealing wards where LTNs had been created, campaigns against them by the Conservatives and local Liberal Democrats – including a specifically anti-LTN visit by the unsuccessful Tory mayoral hopeful Shaun Bailey – appeared to achieve little.While the overall Conservative mayoral vote across Ealing rose by 0.64 percentage points compared with the 2016 mayoral election, it fell across the five LTN-focused wards, as did support for the Lib Dems.Labour was strongly in favour of the schemes, both through the re-elected mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the local council. While the party’s vote dropped in the five wards, it fell less than the borough-wide average, and it took the most first-preference votes in all of them.Across the wards, more than 50% of voters opted for Labour or the Greens, both which back LTNs.

Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Up until May this year, Cadia has previously said, dust from an ore crusher inside the mine was drawn to the surface and released in the atmosphere without filtration, despite it containing heavy metals. The mine has since installed two “bag houses” that catch up to one tonne of dust an hour when operational.In June, after the bag houses were installed but before both were operational, the EPA found the mine was emitting more than 11 times the legal limit of dust into the atmosphere, although recent testing by the regulator has shown air pollutants are now within safe limits.Cleaning rainwater tanks could disrupt EPA investigation of Cadia goldmine, expert warnsRead moreIn June, the EPA published the results of rainwater testing results from 40 properties near the mine which showed most results were within Australia’s drinking water guidelines. Lead was detected “at or marginally above the accepted level” from two kitchen taps, but rainwater tank samples from the same properties were within safe levels.The NSW EPA chief executive, Tony Chappel, said water, soil and air monitoring is ongoing. “All mining operations have mandatory legal obligations regarding air emissions to protect the community and the environment, and the community should be able to have confidence that these obligations are being met,” Chappel said.",

Similarly, the New England zone will now start in 2029 compared with an initial 2027 goal.Labor warns NSW facing a ‘momentous task’ in transition to renewables Read moreThe two zones account for the bulk of the new generation capacity laid out in the renewable energy roadmap, drawn up by the previous Coalition government.The central-west Orana area covers almost 21,000 square km, with the new network able to accommodate 4.5 gigawatts of capacity for new wind and solar farms at a cost of $3.2bn. The New England zone, covering almost 15,500 square km, will provide an initial network capacity of 2.4GW and cost $4.2bn.Initial costings in 2020 had put the cost of $400m-$800m for the central-west Orana alone, Sharpe said, adding “there was not a lot of information” about the network details before she took over the portfolio.

This month Snowy Hydro admitted its giant pumped hydro plant would be delayed until as late as 2029 compared with a 2025 initial target.Sharpe, though, said the snags would not put the state at risk of power outages.“It’s very challenging as the incoming minister to be told that things are going to cost more and take longer,” she said.

The figures show how privatisation – which was intended to lead to a new era of investment, improved water quality and low bills – turned water into a cash cow for investment firms and private equity companies, none more so than the Australian infrastructure asset management firm Macquarie which, with its co-investors, bought Thames Water in 2006 from the German utility firm RWE for £4.8bn.Bar chartBy the time Macquarie sold its stake in Thames Water in 2017, debts had more than tripled from £3.2bn to £10.5bn, unadjusted for inflation. Its pattern was to borrow against its assets to increase dividend payments to shareholders.By 2017, when Macquarie sold its last stake, the pattern of debt remained, and the rate of accruing debt continued on the same trajectory.Bar chartMacquarie and its co-investors made their position clear from the start, hiking dividends in the first year of their operations, 2007, to £656m when profits were a fraction of that at £241m.Over their 11 years of control, Macquarie and its co-investors paid out £2.8bn to shareholders, which is two-fifths of the total £7bn in dividends that Thames Water has paid between 1990 and 2022. The average yearly dividends paid during the Macquarie period were five times higher than those paid after it sold its final stake in 2017.",

        "text": "Tunisia is one of the driest countries in Africa, and has just suffered three years of drought. Yet the EU sees the country as key to producing “green hydrogen” for export to Europe. The trouble is, this fuel is obtained by splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen with electricity generated by renewable sources. Tunisia has lots of sun but precious little fresh water.The only way of producing the raw material needed for green hydrogen is sucking up Mediterranean water and desalinating it. But a report last year for the Heinrich Böll Foundation, affiliated to Germany’s green political movement, warns that this would be a dirty, energy-intensive, water-guzzling process – and put the high cost of decarbonising the rich world on to the shoulders of poorer nations.Many sun-drenched countries, especially in the Maghreb, have been sold a future as export hubs for green hydrogen. The pitch is seductive. As 1kg of hydrogen contains about three times as much energy as 1kg of petrol, it is no wonder that hydrogen is being touted as a fuel of the future. Europe’s green deal, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by the end of the decade, relies on green hydrogen production in north Africa and Ukraine.Producing green hydrogen in Europe is not impossible. But it is expensive compared with fossil fuels, with even wind-based generation needing larger subsidies. Without big government support packages, it remains an open question whether European consumers would be prepared to foot the very significant price rises needed to go green in this way.Last year, the EU proposed doubling green hydrogen imports by 2030 to 10m tonnes a year. The continent’s heavy industries cannot use electricity, however environmentally friendly, for all their requirements; they need fuels for high-intensity heat. So to make sure that these energy sources are less carbon-intensive, Brussels is pushing industries – such as steel or petrochemical manufacturers – to adopt green hydrogen.The benefits of such a strategy – with the desirable goal of low carbon emissions in Europe – cannot come at the cost of environmental destruction abroad.",

It includes modelling, analysis and maps outlining areas at risk of coastal hazard in bayside communities, with 1.3 million Victorians calling coastal areas home.But Victoria’s environment minister, Steve Dimopoulos, on Thursday said it was important to not be “alarmist” about the report.“This is a report for the next 80 years, not a report for the next five minutes,” he said.“I wouldn’t be asking any community to be up in arms and concerned other than just to be informed and work with land managers and us to take mitigation efforts.”Dimopoulos said the government had already funded councils around the bay to undertake their own mitigation strategies.

It was not easy, Wilsher told PA Media news agency, concerned about taking exams for the first time in 35 years and aware his memory was not as sharp as it once was.“Life is not a rehearsal; positive opportunities should be grasped when available,” Wilsher said.“Time goes so quickly, especially for the over-60s, so if you are interested in something, focus on the end goal, not your past hardships.

I learnt so much about a subject which, to some, is still controversial, and I’m grateful I had the chance to do it,” he said.“Mind you, my last science lesson was in 1964, my last geography lecture in 1969 and my last exam in 1987 – surprisingly, some things have changed since then,” said Wilsher, who began his studies in autumn 2021, with help from a bursary from the Welsh government.Without the £4,000 non-repayable grant, the course would have been unaffordable on his pension alone, he said.

Two of the most prolific dunkers showed rusk was preferentially eaten wet. Dried banana chips and dried coconut chips were also occasionally dipped in water, but the duo tended to prefer them dry.“The behaviour seemed to be mainly targeted at rusk, a dry and hard food type that easily absorbs water and adopts a soggy texture,” the team write.The researchers found the seven cockatoos showed considerable variation in how long they left their pieces of rusk in the water, although some left them long enough for the core to go soft – according to the team’s own rusk-dunking experiments.The team say the lack of live prey rules out the possibility the birds were trying to drown their food, while freely available water makes it unlikely they were dunking to gain fluid.Roosters may be able to recognise their reflection, study findsRead more“Seasoning behaviour also seems implausible as they dunk food in fresh, unflavoured tap water,” they write, adding the pickiness of the birds about which foods they dunked suggests they were not trying to wash the food.As a result, the team say the birds probably dunked the rusks to soak them, a strategy they say might improve its texture.",

In April, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report urged world leaders, especially those in developed countries, to support a transition to sustainable, healthy, low-emissions diets.In the UK, Henry Dimbleby, the government’s food tsar, recently said it was politically impossible for a government to tell people to stop eating as much meat. About 85% of agricultural land in England is used as grazing pasture for animals such as cows or to grow food which is then fed to livestock. Dimbleby believes a 30% meat reduction over 10 years is required for land to be used sustainably in England, while Greenpeace argues for a 70% reduction.The clinical trial, published in the journal Jama Network Open, has found that consumers respond well to climate labelling on their foods.Participants in the study, which used a nationally representative sample of adults in the US, were shown a fast food menu and prompted to select one item they would like to order for dinner. Participants were randomised to view menus with one of three labels: a quick response code label on all items (control group); green low–climate impact label on chicken, fish or vegetarian items (positive framing); or red high–climate impact label on red meat items (negative framing).The low–climate impact condition menu stated: “This item is environmentally sustainable.

They also suggested that fitting insulation often happened alongside the building of house extensions, which use extra energy. For households with conservatories, any gains in energy efficiency disappeared after the first year.The government and opposition parties have championed the retrofitting of homes with insulation as a way of dealing with the energy crisis. Ministers have announced insulation retrofits as a leading part of a programme to reduce the energy consumption of buildings and industry by 15% over the next eight years. Labour has said insulating homes should be a “national mission” that could save people £11bn in three years.However, researchers said that while insulation was vital for fighting fuel poverty, it was not a “magic bullet” for reducing energy use and should come alongside advice to conserve energy and programmes to install heat pumps in homes.Researchers said it was hard to identify the exact causes of the rebound effect. However, they stated that turning up the heating, opening windows in stuffy rooms or building extensions could all contribute. They made clear that in circumstances such as the current cost of living crisis, it was possible that energy savings from insulation could be more significant and longer lasting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Revenues at the company increased to £257.5m, up from £251.3m the previous year.Its profits were also hit by soaring operating costs, which jumped from £184m the previous year to £228m in the latest results.Its annual report said shareholders were paid dividends of £9m for the last financial year, the same amount as the year before.

The initiative was promoted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local and state governments across the country.In May, ABC News and affiliates used digital tracking devices to monitor plastic waste dropped off at Walmart and Target stores listed on the directory. Of the 46 trackers placed, the vast majority never ended up at locations associated with plastic bag recycling.“Plastic film recycling had been an abysmal failure for decades and it’s important that plastic companies stop lying to the public,” said Judith Enck, president of advocacy group Beyond Plastics. “Finally, the truth is coming out.”Plastics are a major contributor to the climate crisis. Made from oil and gas, the materials are set to drive nearly half of oil demand growth by midcentury, according to the US International Energy Agency.Producing the materials requires fossil fuel extraction, refining and “cracking” in special high-heat facilities, and plastic waste often ends up in landfills and waste incinerators. Each step produces planet-heating and toxic emissions.Already, the production and disposal of plastics account for 3.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says, and that number is slated to rise.Nina Bellucci Butler, CEO of Stina Inc, which managed the directory, cited a serious lack of commitment from industry partners in the decision to shutter the initiative, as well as meager demand for recycled plastics.“It’s a fine line between maintaining a credible resource to help people find the best option for the common household items that are not easy to eliminate … and enabling greenwashing,” she wrote in an email.",

You can also mix in other leftovers, such as roast vegetables and meat (roast bell peppers, ham and roast pork are especially good).Roast potato tortillaLeftovers are a blessing, and make future meals easier to cook. This Spanish-style tortilla makes a substantial and delicious meal from them; in fact, it’s so good, I often cook extra roast potatoes just so I have some to make it with. I like my tortilla runny in the middle, but if you prefer it more cooked through, give it about six minutes on each side, rather than just three or four. And take care not to spill hot oil on you when flipping the tortilla. If you’d rather not risk the flip, finish it off under the grill or in a hot oven; if you go down that route, however, leave the tortilla soft-set before its final blast, to ensure the best results and texture.Serves 4-6Light olive oil, for frying2 onions, peeled and sliced2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped500g leftover roast potatoes, chopped into cubes6 eggs, lightly beatenSalt and black pepperLight olive oil, for fryingHeat a good drop of oil in a frying pan, then saute the onions for about 10 minutes, until soft.

        "text": "The controversial concept of purposely deflecting the sun’s rays to cool down an overheating Earth should be further studied, according to a group of scientists headed by James Hansen, the renowned former Nasa climate researcher.An open letter from more than 60 scientists across the US, Canada and Europe warns that it is “increasingly unlikely” the world will remain below 2C of heating beyond pre-industrial times, due to a failure to slash greenhouse gas emissions, requiring a “rigorous, rapid scientific assessment” of previously outlandish proposals for solar geoengineering to provide rapid cooling.The letter’s signatories include Hansen, the veteran climate scientist credited with alerting the world to the dangerous escalation of global temperature in the 1980s. While they make clear that cutting emissions is the primary priority, the scientists argue that the full ramifications of the geoengineering, also called solar radiation management (SRM), needs to be understood before it is tried in desperation by a country.“Since decisions on whether or not to implement SRM are likely to be considered in the next one to two decades, a robust international scientific assessment of SRM approaches is needed as rapidly as possible,” the letter states.There are a range of different potential climate interventions to try to artificially curb global heating, such as the brightening of clouds to make them more reflective of sunlight, but the option considered most likely by scientists is the spraying of aerosol particles, such as sulphur, into the stratosphere.These particles would deflect the sun’s rays and rapidly cool the planet, by 1C or maybe even more, although they would only linger temporarily, requiring a constant series of trips by aircraft to spray more aerosols and replenish the reflective material.The basic mechanism behind this is well understood – volcanic eruptions similarly cause sunlight to dim – but solar geoengineering has never been tested fully and faced severe opposition when this has been attempted, due to fears of unknown environmental knock-on impacts and concerns over the lack of governance surrounding the practice.However, with governments still failing to cut emissions quickly enough to avoid disastrous climate change, support has among some powerful entities to research, if not fully deploy, solar geoengineering.",

Photograph: Dr Des CallaghanOut of the 1,029 species with sufficient information available, 191 species (19%) are threatened with extinction, he found. Among the threatened species, 59 species are critically endangered, 52 are endangered and 80 are vulnerable. None of the four hornwort species are threatened: of those on the list, 139 (73%) are mosses and 52 (27%) are liverworts.The assessment, which was funded by Natural England, also revealed “beyond reasonable doubt” that four species had become extinct in Great Britain, “all due to the destruction of their habitat,” said Callaghan, adding that a further 20 species may also be extinct, but that further searches were needed to confirm this.The diversity and beauty of bryophytes are “endlessly astonishing”, he said, noting that “Britain supports one of the richest bryophyte floras in Europe”. Bryophytes had been around for about 500m years and were the first plants to colonise land, he said.“One of the main things that needs to be done to conserve our threatened species is the identification, safeguarding and management of their most important sites,” he said, adding that “this is being done, but much more effort is needed”.Dr Rory Hodd, an independent botanist and ecologist specialising in bryophytes, said: “Red lists such as this one fulfil an essential role in identifying the species in need of conservation action, and highlighting that action is urgently needed.”Although the findings were not surprising, Hodd said, given the “degraded state” of nature in Britain and the many threats to habitats and species there, they were “of great concern”.",

The plan also calls for new housing developments to only be built with a matching investment in local infrastructure, including schools, GP surgeries and sustainable transport. Housing was, Ramsay said, “the big issue” in rural areas, as well as in towns and cities.Opposition parties have sometimes accused Green councillors of nimbyism for opposing developments.

It was definitely behind her, and from the looks of it, its head had to have been underneath her board,” said Barajas to WJZY.Hammerhead sharks have been spotted at other times in Florida’s water.

Guttridge said the hammerhead was likely curious about the presence of the paddleboards.“My guess is that this animal was inquisitive and it saw something novel in the environment,” Guttridge told the Guardian. “You’ve got to think about how this animal was viewing the object.

About 60% of those imports come from China.However, cases of fraud uncovered by investigations suggest a large share of imports could be wrongly labelled as waste instead of repurposed palm oil products. Crop-based biofuels, which were once seen as renewable, are now contributing to deforestation and worsening emissions.A report for the Brussels-based NGO Transport & Environment (T&E) found that while European countries were trying to clamp down on crop-based biofuels, the resultant shift in demand for waste oil was outpacing supply.Europe’s consumption of used cooking oils has more than doubled since 2015, largely to fuel ground transport, and demand is expected to grow as airlines push for sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. Waste cooking oil was the main ingredient in the SAF that solely poweed a UK government-sponsored transatlantic flight by Virgin Atlantic last month.T&E said there were serious concerns about the imports. Barbara Smailagic, a biofuels expert at the NGO, said: “Europe is being flooded with dodgy used cooking oil. European governments say it’s almost impossible to stop virgin oils like palm being labelled as waste. We need greater transparency and a limit on imports to avoid used cooking oil simply becoming a backdoor for deforestation-driving palm oil.”Countries including Germany and Ireland are launching official investigations into fraud risks, while the European Commission has promised to investigate fraudulent Indonesian biodiesel.While imports of palm oil biodiesel have dropped by almost 30%, derivatives of the oil labelled as “waste” or “residues” have increased, which T&E said still had significant environmental impacts.Smailagic said: “Europe never tires of finding new things to burn. Sustainable biofuel feedstocks are extremely limited. We need to stop seeing biofuels as a panacea for our climate problem.",

In the new study researchers tracked people’s heath lung health from being illness-free, to having long-term lung conditions and to early death.By the end of the study, 13,863 people developed either asthma, lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 1,055 then developed multiple lung illness.Fourteen per cent of the people who developed one chronic lung problem then went on to to die during the study, as did 31% of people who developed multiple lung diseases. The study also collected information on lifestyle, including smoking, obesity, occupation and income, so this could be allowed for in the analysis.The impacts were strongest for particle pollution, even though average concentrations near the volunteers’ homes were close to the 2040 target for England and that proposed for the EU for 2030. This suggests that these do not give sufficient levels of protection.Similar patterns were seen for nitrogen dioxide but the method for working out the pollution that people breathed was more complex and less certain.Although the research focused on lung illnesses, 10,562 people in the study in died from other causes, about 4% of the total.",

A wave of thunderstorms and tornadoes in the US over the past few weeks have resulted in the deaths of at least 63 people.Rising global temperatures and moisture levels are likely to make the conditions for the formation of severe storms more favourable, but that does not necessarily mean more tornadoes. It remains uncertain what will happen to wind shear – rapid changes in wind speed or direction – in a heating world, with some climate models indicating it will decrease in the future. Most tornadoes are generated from supercell thunderstorms, which are characterised by a continual rotating updraft, and develop in conditions of strong vertical wind shear.Meanwhile, an unusually long period of La Niña has come to an end. Latest forecast models show that we will see a transition to the El Niño phase over the coming months, perhaps moving to moderate or strong El Niño conditions by late summer.This shift will have significant implications for weather patterns across the globe. La Niña is often associated with more severe tropical storms across the Atlantic, greater precipitation across Australia and western parts of South America, as well an increase in hail and tornado activity across parts of the US.In contrast, El Niño often leads to drought conditions and wildfires across Australia, stronger tropical storms across the Pacific, as well as an increase in average global temperatures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.",

Last week the new chair of the Environment Agency Alan Lovell, said fines of £250m for water companies who pollute were too high for the agency to issue. He said fines in the region of £10-20m would be more appropriate. But he said there should be no set limit on fines imposed through the courts.",

It found the lungs of the rodent residents of Richmond fare far better than those of central Westminster.The research – published last week in the journal Environmental Pollution – highlights the extent of air contamination in cities and suggests that many other species, including wild animals and birds as well as pet cats and dogs, could be affected by particles in the air from traffic and other sources.“In recent years, there have been sharp drops in populations of species that had previously adapted quite well to city life,” said researcher Patricia Brekke of the Zoological Society London. “These have included butterflies, bees, sparrows, starlings and hedgehogs. All have suffered massive recent losses of numbers.”One possible explanation has been the effect of air pollution, although there has been a lack of direct evidence to support the idea in wild mammals. The squirrel research aimed to fill that gap.UK study adds to evidence of air pollution link to long-term illnessRead moreThe grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) – which is native to North America – was introduced to Britain in the late 1800s and has since spread over most of England and Wales at the expense of the native red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris).Apart from being bigger, grey squirrels often carry the squirrelpox virus which rarely affects them but often kills red squirrels. As a result, the grey is now considered to be a pest and culls are carried out regularly. Researchers used these animals as the subjects for their research.The team studied 106 culled animals from five London boroughs – Camden, Greenwich, Haringey, Richmond upon Thames and Westminster – as well as two rural sites at Alice Holt, Surrey and Penrhyn Castle, north Wales. The squirrels were examined for symptoms of lung disease; for the presence of black carbon particles in their lung tissue; and for the signs of damage to lymph node tissue that is known as bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue.",

They found 61,672 people died of heat-related causes in Europe between 30 May and 4 September 2022. The mortality rate was highest in Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal.heatwave mortality graphic 2“There are people that would have died anyway, but those are not counted with this methodology,” said Joan Ballester, an associate research professor in climate and health at Barcelona Institute for Global Health and lead author of the study. “We are talking about people for whom the occurrence of these temperatures triggered their death.”Only a small share of heat-related deaths come from heatstroke. In most cases, hot weather kills people by stopping the body from coping with existing health problems like heart and lung disease.In every week of summer 2022, the study found, average temperatures in Europe “uninterruptedly” exceeded the baseline values of the previous three decades. The most intense heat hit from 18 to 24 July, when it killed 11,637 people.Among the people who died that week was an 86-year-old woman called Maria, who lived alone with no air-conditioning, said Ángel Abad, a doctor at La Paz university hospital in Madrid who was not involved in the study. She took diabetes and heart medication every day but came into the hospital on 19 July complaining of tiredness, he said.

The government claimed the average person in England now bought just two single-use carrier bags a year from major retailers.Campaigners welcomed the finding but said the statistic did not account for all types of plastic bag . They also questioned the timing of the announcement, made as experts said plans for 100 new North Sea oil and gas wells, announced the same day by the prime minister would “send a wrecking ball through the UK’s climate commitments”.A 5p charge for carrier bags was introduced in English supermarkets in 2015. In 2021, the charge was increased to 10p and extended to all businesses. Since then, the number of plastic bags used across all retailers had fallen 35%, from 627m in 2019-20 to 406m in 2022-23, Defra said.Wales had introduced a 5p charge in 2011, Northern Ireland followed suit in 2013 and Scotland did so in 2014. Scotland and Northern Ireland have since raised their charges to 10p and 25p respectively.“This 98% reduction in single-use plastic bags shows inserting a plastic tax at the point of sale is a good policy for reducing consumer plastic bag use,” said Steve Hynd of City to Sea, which campaigns for an end to the production of single-use plastics. But he said the data did not include sales of bags for life, nor did it break down the distribution between in-store shopping and home delivery.The charge is one of several measures introduced by the government to reduce the production of single-use plastics.",

The former is a benign and beautiful plant originating in Brazil and Chile, while the latter is highly invasive, spreading rapidly and choking native flora. It has been illegal to sell or cultivate G tinctoria since 2017, while G manicata (or plants believed to be G manicata) has been widely available and celebrated for its exotic look.Now a study by the Royal Horticultural Society, which involved molecular and morphological analyses, as well as a historical investigation, has revealed that G manicata appears to have been lost from cultivation not long after it was introduced. In its place, the researchers found a hybrid between G manicata and G tinctoria, which has been named Gunnera × cryptica.This species has been found to be similarly invasive to G tinctoria and will now be banned. There are fears the widespread nature of this plant will cause problems, such as those caused by G tinctoria, where it has spread in wetter areas such a the west coast of Ireland and Scotland. It has been listed as a “species of union concern” under an EU regulation, and is now listed as being of “special concern” in the UK.There are collections of Gunnera across the UK and it is widely planted in gardens, so the RHS anticipates significant implications for the horticultural industry.New advice from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said the hybrid should be treated as a banned species, so the RHS is changing its advice to gardeners about G manicata plants, which are almost certain to be the invasive hybrid, removing them from shops, and identifying any of the hybrid plants in its gardens.",

Federal rules require government agencies to respond to petitions “within a reasonable time”.“Given the magnitude of the health and environmental threats, competing priorities do not justify further delay,” the lawsuit argues.Livestock and poultry create about 1.4bn tons of manure a year, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Factory farms often store manure in ponds that can overflow into streams, lakes or rivers and leach into groundwater.Manure causes nitrogen and phosphorus in water, tainting drinking water and causing toxic algal blooms that can be deadly to aquatic life. Waste-polluted water can irritate skin and cause gastrointestinal and respiratory problems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The agency itself has said that three-quarters of factory farms discharge pollution, said Emily Miller, an attorney for advocacy group Food & Water Watch, the lead petitioner. But EPA has essentially let companies decide whether they want to comply with the Clean Water Act, she said.“EPA has set up a catch-me-if-you-can system,” Miller said. Factory farms “only have to get Clean Water Act permits if they admit they discharge, which is obviously not an incentive to do so”.Federal authorities have been “reluctant” to regulate factory farms since the Clean Water Act passed in 1972, said Anthony Schutz, an associate dean and associate professor at the University of Nebraska law school. “There’s a powerful agricultural lobby that doesn’t support regulation,” Schutz said. “It would rather see pollution abatement accomplished through voluntary actions.”If the lawsuit is successful, he said, it could lead the EPA to push states to tighten pollution enforcement or risk losing their ability to regulate agriculture.",

In 2021, the party earmarked £28bn a year for a green industrial strategy to rid the economy of its carbon addiction and create a wave of “clean jobs”. This summer, however, the spending was postponed to the second half of the next parliament. Then it was reported that it would take a full term to ultimately redeem the pledge. Last week, because of self-imposed fiscal rules, Sir Keir suggested it might not happen. This was unsettling, especially as Labour is miles ahead in the polls. Yet more disappointment is in store. On Tuesday, according to reports, the Labour leader will extol the virtues of small technocratic policies rather than big transformative ones.Sir Keir is mistaken if he thinks he can avoid a fight by not turning up. British governments are unusually free to overhaul the country’s economy, but electoral support is the crucial precondition for such changes. Green policies won’t happen by themselves. This week, Cop28 will reach a climax, spotlighting the climate emergency. Inaction is not an option: relying on volatile gas prices would cost Britain double that of achieving 2050 net zero targets. Sir Keir knows that Labour spending will be caricatured as a “tax bombshell” by the Tories. Ministers hope to overwhelm facts with emotional force. But Labour should take heart that Rishi Sunak’s U-turn on climate targets in September, coupled with a conspiracy-laden assault on the opposition, fell flat with voters.In a cost of living crisis, Sir Keir is right to worry that a majority of Britons think getting to net zero means higher prices. But who pays for green plans can be answered by Labour saying Britain can borrow to invest. Labour has vote-winning policies: strengthening energy security, generating employment and creating new industries. The cost of new technologies, such as heat pumps, will fall as they are more widely adopted. Sir Keir could also sell his green prosperity plan as a way of helping households by promising cheaper energy bills. Properly taxing oil and gas windfall profits would mean less borrowing.",

The price hike is due to the increasing cost of gas.At the Conservative Environment Network (CEN) net zero conference in Westminster on Monday, Graham Stuart refused to apologise to the British public for rising bills.When asked by the Guardian if he would take responsibility on behalf of the government for sluggishness on insulation, heat pump installations and renewables investment, he refused and instead criticised the previous Labour government, which was last in office in 2010.He said the Conservative action on energy efficiency “has been transformational since the rather dire position we inherited both on renewables and efficiency from Labour”.When it was pointed out that Conservative MPs were among those who had criticised the government’s lack of action, he said: “That’s exactly why it’s so good to have CEN members of parliament, because they push the government to go further.”The shadow climate minister, Kerry McCarthy, said: “Graham Stuart is living in a fantasy world.

Experts have warned this measure will cost growers more in the long run as they will have to pay high energy prices.Lydia Collas, a senior policy analyst at the thinktank Green Alliance, said: “Diluting energy efficiency targets for horticulture will do little to help growers who are struggling to turn a profit. Some didn’t plant last year because energy prices were so high that they knew they wouldn’t recover costs. With less support to cut energy use, their costs will stay high, as will their emissions. This will undermine the competitiveness of UK horticulture as a whole and incentivise imports.”Farming campaigners are celebrating, however, referring to the reduced targets as “sustainable energy practices”.The NFU’s deputy president, Tom Bradshaw, said: “The revision of these targets is a win for collaboration and the commitment to sustainable energy practices, and they are now fair and realistic for the horticulture and poultry businesses involved in the scheme.”The energy efficiency targets are voluntary and part of the climate change agreement scheme, which is an agreement between UK industry and the Environment Agency to reduce energy use and carbon dioxide emissions. In return, those who contribute to the scheme receive a discount on the climate change levy, a tax added to electricity and fuel bills.The NFU’s energy managing director, Tim Crocker, said: “This is a significant victory for horticulture and poultry businesses participating in the climate change agreement scheme.",

The answer, they found, was yes. “We did a multi-varied analysis to see whether the underlying theory was statistically significant and it is.”The study, which looked at more than 2,000 attacks in east Africa and the South China Sea over the past 20 years, found the trends in piracy were linked to the impact of warmer seas on fish stocks.In east Africa, where fish populations are declining due to warmer seas, piracy rates have increased. But rising sea temperature had the opposite effect in the South China Sea. There, fish populations have increased and piracy rates have declined.“In a timeline of roughly 20 years, we’re picking up statistically significant, measurable differences,” LaFree said. “I was surprised by how rapidly those changes are occurring, especially when you think of climate change most likely accelerating in the future.”Previous studies quoted in the paper show that fishers, who already have seafaring skills and are some of the poorest communities in the world, are targeted by criminal syndicates engaged in piracy.“You tend to think either you are a criminal or a non-criminal,” said LaFree. “But there is evidence from other researchers that some fishermen drift into it, depending on how fishing is going.",

Giving with one hand and taking with another, by diverting cash from an already depleted aid budget, won’t help those on the frontline of this crisis. Any backsliding on this commitment would leave any remaining semblance of the UK’s global climate leadership in tatters.”Sunak has drawn up plans to ditch the promise, the Guardian revealed earlier this month, after a leaked document showed officials had warned that the spending commitments to climate breakdown mitigation in the world’s most vulnerable countries were not being made.The £11.6bn is the UK’s contribution to the $100bn of climate finance from wealthy countries that was pledged in 2009 at Cop15 in Copenhagen has still not been delivered by rich nations.The UK spent £5.8bn over the previous five years up to 2021. This was doubled to£11.6bn between April 2021 and March 2026, £3bn of which was earmarked for protecting and restoring nature, meeting commitments made in Cop15 last December. This is now at risk, with civil servants revealing in a leaked briefing that it was almost impossible to meet the funding at current levels of spending. The Labour party has also refused to commit to meeting the target.",

        "text": "The strong reaction to the Guardian’s joint investigation into carbon offsetting shows how much is at stake when the effectiveness of market mechanisms in combating global heating is challenged. Already, in Australia, politicians and scientists have renewed their criticism of public entities using international carbon credit schemes to offset local emissions. Verra, the Washington-based non-profit at the centre of the story, is the world’s leading carbon standard, certifying the credits that companies use to make claims about their environmental impact. It is a blow to anyone committed to the idea that emissions trading can help the world to reach net zero, to learn that 90% of the rainforest credits analysed are unlikely to represent genuine carbon reductions.The problem, which was uncovered by journalists working alongside experts using satellite images, is the methodology used by Verra to certify its credits. While Verra disputes the findings, and is due to publish its own assessment, the researchers found that the evidence used to calculate offsets was flawed. Predictions of what would have happened in the absence of credits were unreliable, and benefits were overstated.Given Verra’s importance, the significance of the findings goes beyond a single organisation. What happens next is crucial, and will be closely watched by governments and businesses around the world. The question is: can existing processes be improved? Here, academics and environmental campaigners are divided. Carbon markets have long been controversial, with some arguing that any attempt to protect nature by assigning it monetary value is doomed. According to this view, the focus on nature conservation and restoration of recent years has been co-opted and corrupted by corporate interests, including fossil fuel producers who are among the biggest purchasers of carbon credits.Defenders of emissions trading, however, insist that while such greenwashing must be called out, carbon markets have a role to play. Governments will not provide the necessary funds to protect the world’s rainforests. Therefore there is no alternative but to direct private capital towards them and other carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots. If the existing ways of doing this don’t work, better ones must be developed. Our investigation discovered three projects in Madagascar that were excellent.",

Because data doesn’t support the idea that overeating and lack of exercise are squarely to blame, the scientific community is exploring other factors that may contribute – including metabolic disruption caused by eating products packaged in plastic.The Guardian view on obesity: prevention is as important as cure | EditorialRead moreFor a study published last year, researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology set out to determine what chemical compounds exist in 34 common plastic items that touch things we eat, such as yogurt cups, juice bottles, styrofoam meat trays, gummy-candy packages, and plastic wrap used for produce and cheese, as well as items often found in kitchens, like polyurethane placemats and sponges.Of the 55,000 chemicals the researchers found in these items, only 629 were identifiable, with 11 being known metabolic disruptors such as phthalates and bisphenols, which interfere with our bodies’ ability to regulate weight, among other troubling health effects. However, when exposed to in vitro human cell cultures (studies have not used human or animal test subjects), far more chemicals than the identified 11 metabolic disruptors triggered adipogenesis – the process underlying obesity, in which cells proliferate and accumulate an excess of fat.“[W]e’re quite certain [that] there are many chemicals in plastic products that disrupt metabolism, but we just couldn’t identify all of them,” Martin Wagner, a study co-author said. Strikingly, Wagner and his colleagues found that a third of all the common products they tested contain chemicals that trigger the adipogenic process. Although we are exposed to them daily, most of these mystery chemicals are unknown, unstudied and unregulated.Plastics are made when chemical compounds from refined fossil fuels are mixed with various other, often toxic, chemicals to promote desired characteristics like flexibility and water resistance.",

There would be other steps, both unprecedented and bold. Volunteers with the Hellenic Red Cross had been seconded to distribute free bottles of water, first-aid rescue workers had been dispatched to the site, and shading had been erected at the main entrance to the Golden Age temples. It was hoped the media could inform foreigners because it was a “very difficult” day.In what would be the hottest day of the year – with the mercury hitting 45C (113F) in Syntagma Square and likely reaching 48C (118F) on the rocky outcrop on which the Acropolis stands – “difficult” soon resembled a war footing at the base of Greece’s most visited monument.By noon, 30,000 water bottles had been handed out – the fruit of donations to the Red Cross; men, women and children who had either collapsed or fainted had received first aid in field tents; and some 11,000 visitors had filed through the fifth-century BC wonder, frequently escorted by guides entreating them to “move faster” to escape temperatures seen as the invisible enemy.By 8pm, when the gates to the site were closed, almost twice that number had made the gruelling ascent. Among them on Friday was Annali Kemp with her two teenage children and husband, Steve, who baulked when she saw the queues and came close to leaving before being “spurred on” by her family to stay.“To think it’s only mid-July and we’ve got August to come,” said the 53-year-old Briton, visibly red-faced after the exertions of the climb.",

The embankments of both are sites of special scientific interest due to the presence of a wide variety of grassland fungi, and Lisvane is an important wintering spot for diving ducks.In 2000, the reservoirs were acquired by Western Power Distribution, which proposed to build more than 320 houses and flats.

The first official data since the latest expansion showed that the number of older, more polluting vehicles in London had dropped by nearly half in a month, with an average 95% of vehicles driven in the city now compliant and not subject to a fee.

The climate has been warming faster in Svalbard than the world’s average.“As a polar bear, you have exposure to toxic manmade chemicals, and stresses from a changing habitat,” he added.PFAS are a class of about 12,000 chemicals often used to make thousands of consumer products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and they are linked to cancer, liver disease, kidney stress, fetal complications and other serious health problems.Among PFAS compounds researchers found in ice at levels above US advisory drinking water limits were PFOS and PFOA, which are considered to be two of the most dangerous.The study also found particularly high levels of TFA, a refrigeration byproduct.

Its adjusted earnings hit $36bn and it said it would buy back a further $2bn of its own shares.The pair become the latest oil and gas giant to report record profits aided by soaring gas prices linked to the war in Ukraine, after similar results from Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP.Equinor supplies about a quarter of Britain’s gas and hopes to develop the Rosebank field, to the west of Shetland despite vociferous opposition from climate protesters.

Pollution also triggers asthma, asthma attacks and chest infections.Once the zone is extended to the North Circular and South Circular, it will cover a huge area of London, and officials estimate 100,000 cars, 35,000 vans and 3,000 lorries will be affected per day.It will also include a “particulate matter standard”, after the Guardian revealed every part of London exceeds World Health Organization air quality guidelines for PM2.5 – the most dangerous particulate.Paul Morozzo, a clean air campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “It’s going to have a huge impact on air quality and make a real difference to Londoners’ quality of life.

The clans might meet but they never interbred, he added. Their sense of identity appeared, in human terms, almost tribal, recognising and maintaining their differences while being of the same species.Sperm whales have the biggest brains on the planet. The animals can reach 15 metres in length, weigh up to 45 tonnes, and are able to dive for up to two hours in search of food, mostly squid. They are present in oceans around the world.Whitehead noted that the clans appeared to be “almost entirely female-based”. Males visited females occasionally and for only a few hours at a time. Their “only important transfer is of sperm”. Designated females undertook “alloparental” care, looking out for calves while their mothers dived for food.While underlining how different whales were from humans, the paper suggested intriguing correspondences. Sperm whale society appeared to use consensus, rather than top-down leadership, to reach communal decisions.With thousands of animals travelling at the same time, searching for fast-changing food sources and constantly aware of predators (killer whales will prey on sperm whale calves), these debates can be very important. Whitehead said he had seen whales “taking up to an hour or more to make a 90-degree turn” as they tried to agree where to go.The democracy of whales was a “slow and messy” business, Whitehead observed, just like our own.",

There is no reason we shouldn’t be doing so in Wales.”But the Brecon and Radnorshire Tory MP, Fay Jones, questioned the cost and impact of the rebrand. “I am worried that this is symbolic,” she said. “This is about looking trendy and jumping on a sustainability bandwagon for PR purposes.”Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Tory leader, said: “The Beacons are as recognisable outside of Wales as they are here. Why undermine that?”The Welsh Conservative shadow minister for mid-Wales, James Evans, said: “I am concerned that the whole rebranding exercise by the national park is not a priority for the people and the businesses who live in the park. Many of the residents will also be wondering how much the rebranding exercise is going to cost.",

This is just 0.02% of the onshore wind needed in England based on forecasts provided by National Grid.National Grid’s influential industry forecast report, the Future Energy Scenarios, estimates that onshore wind capacity needs to increase to more than 30 gigawatts across Great Britain by 2030. At the current pace, it would take 4,690 years for England to meet its share of this target, according to the IPPR.The left-leaning thinktank has called on the government to undertake “fundamental planning reform” to England’s planning system to help speed up the rollout of onshore windfarms as well as restore nature and meet the country’s growing housing needs.Maya Singer Hobbs, a senior research fellow at the IPPR and the lead report author, said: “None of the failures of the English system are inevitable. The de facto ban on onshore wind, the lack of coherence in environmental regulations and the lack of good quality housing are all solvable by reforming the system.",

But according to research published on Wednesday, only Scotland, Wales, and the south-east and east of England met it.Yet none of these regions were in the top five for accessibility of green space. Overall, 2,779,065 people in Britain, about one in 24 people, lived more than 10 minutes from the nearest park. The worst region for accessibility to green space was Wales, where one in 13 people lived more than 10 minutes from a park or public garden.The findings come from Fields in Trust’s green spaces index, published every year since 2019. The charity’s guidance for outdoor sport and play, first published in the 1930s, recommends a minimum of 6 acres (2.4 hectares) of accessible green space – such as parks, public gardens, nature reserves and playing fields – per 1,000 people.Top 10 green spaces in England and Wales for ‘welfare value’ named in studyRead moreA spokesperson for the charity said it only published data for broad regions to avoid setting up a “league table” that would unfairly single out certain areas. But cross-referencing findings with those areas prioritised for the government’s levelling up agenda showed they had on average 10% less green space than the standard, the charity said.The index exposed large disparities between regions. People in Scotland, the best-served part of Britain, had 41 sq metres of public green space per person, more than double the 19 sq metres available to Londoners.However, even those living in regions with more green space could find those areas comparatively more inaccessible. The figures showed about one in 17 people in Scotland lived more than 10 minutes walk from their nearest green space, compared to almost as few as one in 1,000 in London.There were no publicly available maps or datasets of green space in Northern Ireland.",

The division’s webpage, which is adorned with pictures of wind turbines and solar panels, says it is working to invest in “wind, solar, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen, and more”.Shell and BP face tough job of keeping customers and investors happy as profits roll inRead moreHowever, Global Witness, the activist group that has lodged the new complaint with the SEC, argues that just 1.5% of Shell’s capital expenditure has been used to develop genuine renewables, such as wind and solar, with much of the rest of the division’s resources devoted to gas, which is a fossil fuel.“What Shell has said about the energy transition is not reflected in what they are doing,” said Zorka Milin, senior adviser at Global Witness. “This business unit is fundamentally mislabeled, it has very little in the way of renewables and investors could be lulled into thinking Shell is doing far more on renewables than it is.“This is greenwashing. Gas, whatever it may be, is not renewable, it’s part of the problem. I hope the SEC opens an investigation and imposes appropriate penalties to stop this greenwashing.”Shell does not have a full breakdown of its renewable energy activity in its annual reports but Global Witness said that by examining the document they could find $288m in wind and solar investment in 2021, which is equivalent to 1.5% of Shell’s capital expenditure. Much of the spending by the Renewables and Energy Solutions division appears to be on the trading and marketing of gas.",

At least three people died in the floods, up to 600 had to evacuate their homes, and power cuts affected a further 80,000.Storms began on the Friday (21 July) and continued into Sunday, with some areas seeing three months’ worth of rain – about 250 mm – in the space of 24 hours. It had already been a particularly wet summer for Nova Scotia. The provincial capital, Halifax, had its third wettest June on record, receiving more than double the amount of rain that had fallen in the three months prior.Last week’s storm caused damage to buildings and infrastructure, with several roads washed away and at least seven bridges believed to need major repair or replacement.The northern Philippines and Taiwan have also received heavy rainfall. Typhoon Doksuri threaded between the two nations as it tracked north-eastwards into the South China Sea, achieving a peak category 4 status in the Philippine Sea on Tuesday, with winds of up to 150mph, before weakening to category 3 as it skirted the northern Philippines on Wednesday. It brought widespread damage and significant flooding to the northern island of Luzon, and almost 400mm of rainfall was recorded in some areas.Doksuri further weakened to category 2 as it passed to the south-west of Taiwan on Thursday but heavy rainfall continued, with up to 700mm recorded in places.

It has found that all of London’s hospitals, medical centres and care homes are in areas that breach the World Health Organization’s guidelines for nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter.The expanded Ulez would cut the number of the most polluting cars on London’s roads by a further 20,000-40,000 daily.

The WHO completed a review of its 2005 guideline air quality levels in September 2021, halving its limit for PM2.5 to five micrograms.Air pollution has long been implicated in a number of respiratory disorders but, the researchers noted, a growing body of evidence is establishing a link with mental health disorders. So far, however, the only available studies on the risk of depression were carried out in regions with air pollution concentrations exceeding UK air quality limits.The researchers drew on the data of 389,185 participants from the UK Biobank, modelling and giving a score to the air pollution, including PM2.5 and PM10, nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide for the areas in which they lived. They found 13,131 cases of depression and 15,835 of anxiety were identified among their sample within a follow-up period of about 11 years.As air pollution increased, the researchers found, so did cases of depression and anxiety. Exposure-response curves were non-linear, however, with steeper slopes at lower levels and plateauing trends at higher exposure, suggesting that long-term exposure to low levels of pollution were just just as likely to lead to diagnoses as exposure to higher levels.The researchers said they hoped policymakers would take their findings into account.",

A second site, at Inner Silver Pit South, would not be designated as the high cost to fishers would not be offset by the designation, the government said.The remaining three sites, at Allonby Bay in Cumbria, Dolphin Head in the eastern Channel and north-east of Farnes Deep, in the North Sea, will be created before 6 July this year, enabling nature to recover by banning harmful activities, including fishing, construction and dredging. They were chosen because of the ecological importance of nature recovery in the sites, the government said.In a statement announcing the decision, the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said: “Highly protected marine areas are a vital step forward in enabling our ecosystems to thrive, increasing climate resilience and ensuring we have a healthy and productive marine environment for generations to come.”A report by Lord Benyon, the former environment and fisheries minister, in 2019/20 into HPMAs recommended five sites as the “bare minimum” of a pilot to assess the success of the approach.Prof Callum Roberts, a marine conservationist at the University of Exeter, said the dropping of two proposed pilot sites was disappointing. “It’s taken three years and eight months to get here from the Benyon report recommendation. At this rate, we’ll get to 30% effective protection in 260 years. That isn’t a timescale that inspires confidence, and nor is it a sensible time over which to build ecosystem resilience to climate change.",

I feel blessed that she said yes and her team is donating their work and all proceeds to this battle.”There was an “elegant resonance” to the fact that her voice was the same age as Rosalía’s on the recording, said the singer, who will be 58 on Tuesday. Rosalía helped her update the track, with production by Sega Bodega.The open-pen salmon-farming industry has come under scrutiny in Iceland after revelations that thousands of farmed salmon had escaped, raising fears over the threat to wild salmon from interbreeding.Earlier this month, the Guardian obtained film footage of diseased, dead and dying salmon on a farm after a sea-lice outbreak described as a “welfare disaster” by veterinary experts.Sea-lice outbreak on Icelandic salmon farm a ‘welfare disaster’, footage showsRead moreBjörk accused the Norwegian companies Mowi and SalMar of damaging “large areas of our fjords, marine life, animals and plants”. Mowi is the parent company of Arctic Fish, one of Iceland’s largest salmon-farming companies and is being investigated by police after the mass escape from pens in a fjord in September. SalMar owns the Icelandic company Arnarlax, which along with Arctic Fish, owns open pens affected by the sea-lice outbreak in November.In October, Björk said artists were often the “canaries in the coalmine” of environmental emergencies because it was their job to be sensitive.",

        "text": "Labour’s new environment team says it will take on big businesses and supermarkets in order to halt pollution and stop farmers from being ripped off if it wins the next election.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has been criticised in the past for being too soft on polluting companies, and not using its full powers to stop water companies from spilling sewage. Farming groups have also criticised its close relationship with supermarkets, when farmers have felt ripped off by rising prices not being passed down the supply chain to their struggling businesses.The Labour Defra team is getting ready to release its strategy for governing if the party wins the election next year. Shadow ministers say they would take on big businesses by handing out criminal sanctions to chief executives who run polluting companies, and fixing the supply chain so farmers are paid a fair price for food sold in supermarkets.Labour sources said fighting for justice for neglected rural communities, who have had their local areas polluted, and been ripped off by big businesses such as supermarkets, was a key part of their election campaign. Winning rural and coastal seats is likely to prove crucial to the party’s chances of commanding a majority.Steve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, told an event at the Labour party conference in Liverpool that he would get tough on the CEOs of companies that repeatedly contaminate the environment, making them personally criminally liable for pollution.Reed told an event hosted by the thinktank Onward: “Where you’ve got such widespread law breaking, which is what’s going on there, I think you have to take action of that kind and I see this as fundamentally very pro-business as well. It’s very pro-business because good decent businesses, the vast majority of businesses, operate within the legal regulatory framework.“That’s the level playing field that makes business and the economy work properly. If you get some businesses that can get away with breaking the law, or making additional profits that way, then you haven’t got a level playing field. So it supports business by stopping businesses that are breaking the law from having that advantage.",
